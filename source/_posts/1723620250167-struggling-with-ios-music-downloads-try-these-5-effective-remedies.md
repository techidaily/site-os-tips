 Apple not only introduces serious copyright regulations into iOS devices, but also uses a unique file system. If you tend to add music in the formats that iPhone does not support, it will fail without problem. Moreover, you cannot add copy-protected songs to iPhone through iTunes.

Step 1 Before adding music to iTunes library, convert your files to MP3 or AAC.

Step 2 Go to "File" > "Add File to Library" in your iTunes. Connect iPhone to your computer and make sure to update both iOS and iTunes to the latest version.

Step 3 Choose "Songs" from the left sidebar for your iPhone. Drag the music to iPhone that cannot add to iPhone previously.

* To make a YouTube video play in a loop on your iPhone, tap the three dots on the video playback page and select "Loop Video".

 Using just the [built-in features in iPhone's Photos](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-android-capture-king-spam-free-edition/) and YouTube app, you can make your videos play in a loop for as long as you want. This eliminates the need to manually re-play your videos, and we'll show you how to do that.

##  Play a Video in iPhone's Photos App in a Loop

 In iPhone's Photos app, you don't have an official feature to play your video itself in a loop. But, you can [make a slideshow](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-facebook-blue-verification-a-step-by-step-guide/) out of your video and make that play in a loop, which basically plays your video until you manually stop it.

 To use this workaround, first, launch Photos on your iPhone. Then tap the video you'd like to play in a loop.

 On the video page, in the bottom-left corner, tap the share icon (an arrow pointing upwards).

![Select the share icon in the bottom-left corner.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1-iphone-video-share-menu.png) 

 From the share menu, select "Slideshow."

![Choose "Slideshow" in the menu.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2-make-slideshow-iphone.png) 

 Photos will play your video as a slideshow, but this slideshow has a specific theme, background music, and only plays once (not on loop). To change these settings, in the slideshow's bottom-right corner, tap "Options."

![Select "Options" at the lower-right corner.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/3-iphone-slideshow-options.png) 

 On the "Slideshow Options" page, tap "Theme."

![Select "Theme."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/4-iphone-slideshow-theme.png) 

 On the "Themes" screen, choose a simple theme so you can focus on your video. "Origami" is a good option. Then, in the top-left corner, tap "Back."

![Choose "Origami" and tap "Back."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5-change-iphone-slideshow-theme.png) 

 Turn off the slideshow music so you can hear your video's audio. Do this by selecting "Music" and tapping "None." Then go back to the previous page.

![Select "Music" and tap "None."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6-disable-iphone-slideshow-music.png) 

 Put your video in a loop by enabling the "Repeat" option. Then, in the top-right corner, tap "Done" to save your changes.

![Enable "Repeat" and tap "Done."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/7-loop-iphone-slideshow.png) 

 Photos will take you back to your video screen. Here, your video will play in a loop until you manually close it.

 And that's how you continue to watch your favorite videos on your iPhone!

           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">

	<div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975555%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);">Click here</a></div>

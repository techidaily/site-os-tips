## How to Mount iPhone/iPad as a Flash Drive

In [DearMob iPhone Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/iphone-manager/), you can mount your iPhone or iPad as a flash drive. That is to say, any of your files, even including the documents that are not incompatible with Apple can be saved to your iPhone/iPad, and exported to another computer whenever you need. Compared with cloud storage, this method is safer, quicker, and independent of network connection.

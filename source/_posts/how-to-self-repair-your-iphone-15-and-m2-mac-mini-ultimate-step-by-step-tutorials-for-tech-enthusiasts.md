## How To Self-Repair Your iPhone 15 & M2 Mac Mini - Ultimate Step-by-Step Tutorials for Tech Enthusiasts

While [concerns remain](https://howto.techidaily.com/android-safe-mode-how-to-turn-off-safe-mode-on-vivo-y02t-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) about some of Apple's practices related to this program, the company's self-service repair program has contributed to changing its reputation with right-to-repair enthusiasts and, of course, the growing number of laws rallying behind this movement. Now, Apple seems to be getting better at making parts for some of its newer devices available, as it's making several more devices available through the self-repair program.

 Apple has announced that it's officially adding new devices to Self-Service Repair, including the latest [iPhone 15](https://meme-emoji.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-make-a-memorable-honeymoon-video/). The 15-inch MacBook Air, the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with M2 processors, the Mac mini, the Mac Pro, and the Mac Studio have also been added to the list. Notably, we're still lacking some Mac computers. Namely, the [M3-powered MacBook Pro computers](https://solve-manuals.techidaily.com/cookiebot-driven-personalization-enhancing-your-sites-user-experience/), as well as the [new iMac](https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-10-google-cardboards-most-stunning-vr-games/).

 Even though there are still some gaps, this is an improvementâ€”Apple made the parts for the iPhone 15 available just three months after the phone was released to store shelves. Compare that to the iPhone 14, a phone released in September 2022 that wasn't included in Self-Service Repair [until June this year](https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-the-serenity-seekers-guide-to-relaxed-youtube-viewing-52-chars/), nine months later.

 Apple is also making its Apple Diagnostics tool available for users in the US. This will let you test the parts on whatever device you happen to be repairing/want to repair and will let you know if something needs repairing. The company is also rolling out its program to a bunch of extra countries in Europe, thus bringing the total of countries it's available to 33\. It still has a long way to go before it can be called "global," but it's certainly a start. Some of the countries where the program has been rolled out include Croatia, Portugal, Greece, and Switzerland.

 There's still work that needs to be done on the self-repair program, though. To start, the program still doesn't have any parts for iPads, Apple Watches, or other devices. Also, all the repairs still need to be validated by Apple before they can work without your phone nagging you. Being quicker at adding its newer devices is a start, but we're expecting a little bt more from [the world's first $3 trillion dollar company](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/03/investing/apple-three-trillion-dollar-market-cap/index.html).

## Catch the Game Anywhere with Apple's Newly Launched Free Sports Application!

Apple released a new app called Apple Sports today, giving fans an easier way to check scores and follow along with all their favorite players and teams. With [Apple TV Plus](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/exclusive-lineup-top-10-sources-for-vector-imagery/) airing more sports content than ever, its subscribers will now have one free app full of scores, highlights, stats, and more.

 While it's a little late for the NFL season, Apple Sports is arriving just in time for March Madness, the MLB season later next month, not to mention the NHL, as teams battle it out to reach the playoffs. Initially, the new Apple Sports app is only available in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. and will share scores, stats, play-by-play information, betting odds, and more for some of the top leagues around the globe. For now, those include MLS, NBA, NCAA, NHL, Bundesliga, LaLiga, Liga MX, Ligue 1, Premier League, and Serie A. Then, in the future, Apple plans to add the MLB, NFL, NCASF, WNBA, and more in time for upcoming seasons.

 It's an exciting move from the company and one that'll give popular sports aggregators like ESPN, CBS Sports, Yahoo! Sports, and Bleacher Report a run for their money. I've long used the Yahoo Sports app, which certainly has its pros and cons, but Apple Sports could be a quick replacement. Apple says it designed the app with speed and simplicity in mind, ensuring fans can easily and quickly find the stats they're looking for.

 "We created Apple Sports to give sports fans what they want — an app that delivers incredibly fast access to scores and stats. Apple Sports is [available for free in the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-sports/id6446788829), and makes it easy for users to stay up to date with their favorite teams and leagues," said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Services.

 Like many sports apps, with Apple Sports, you'll be able to customize the entire experience to follow your favorite team and league. Additionally, fans can switch from scores to play-by-play information, lineup details, injury reports, and betting odds. Apple notes that fans can also disable and hide betting odds if they'd rather not see the lines.

 And finally, the app will let users quickly tap "watch on Apple TV" for select sports, like the MLB and MLS, for which its streaming service has inked deals and streaming rights over the past few years.

 Looking at the same phone day in and day out can get a little boring. It turns out there's a very simple way to inject some novelty into your most-used device—change the wallpaper! And I'm not talking about changing it up a couple of times per year. I change mine almost every day, and it's pretty great.

##  It's the Easiest Way to Freshen Up My Phone

 There are plenty of options when it comes to breathing new life into a phone you've been using for a while. [You can swap cases](https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/artificial-intelligence-the-next-level-for-bing/), [theme the home screen icons](https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-reducing-motion-illusion-in-vr-environments/), [try out some new widgets](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-trending-hashtags-on-instagram/), and even [change the home screen launcher](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/top-10-password-cracking-tools-for-realme-gt-3-by-drfone-android/) completely if you're an Android user. However, [nothing is easier than a fresh wallpaper](https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/premium-editing-platform-tailored-to-vimeo/).

 Unlike the desktop on your computer, which is probably hidden behind the browser or other apps most of the time, you actually look at your phone wallpaper many times throughout the day. Changing the wallpaper seems like a small thing, but it's very noticeable. You may be surprised by just how big of a difference it makes.

 This is especially true if you're like me and you try to stick with the same phone for a while. I've been using my Pixel 7 for a little over a year, and while that may not seem long to some people, it's an eternity for someone who loves new gadgets. A constantly changing carousel of wallpapers helps keep that "new" feeling around.

##  Changing Wallpaper Like I Change My Clothes

 One of the reasons why I change my wallpaper so often is I like to match it with whats happening in my life. This is something I've always done, even going back to when I only had a laptop. There are so many things that can spur a wallpaper change.

 Going to a football game? I'm using a photo I took of the stadium. First snow of the season? Let's add some wintery vibes to the home screen. Pancake breakfast this weekend? I need to see flapjacks and dripping syrup every time I unlock my phone. Tie-dye week for my kickball team? You know the drill.

 Does anyone ever see my wallpaper and comment on my cool coordination efforts? No, but that's not the point. I do it because it's fun and I can. There's a glowing rectangle in my pocket that can display anything I want it to. Why shouldn't I take full advantage of that?

##  My Favorite Wallpaper Apps

 As you can imagine, it's not always easy to find nice wallpapers to use so often. And if you didn't think I was crazy enough already, I almost never use the same wallpaper more than once. There are a few apps that I rely on for discovering wallpapers worthy of my home screen.

### **Backdrops** 

Close 

 Backdrops is, without a doubt, my favorite wallpaper app, and it has been for years. Original wallpapers created exclusively for the app are uploaded almost every day, plus there's a "Community" tab where people can upload their own. I've also paid for "Backdrops Pro" to unlock some of the premium "Collections." If you spot me out in the wild and ask to see my phone, there's a good chance the wallpaper is from Backdrops.

### **Tapet** 

Close 

 Tapet is the app I turn to when I want to get my hands dirty. It's essentially a random wallpaper generator, but you can steer it in the direction you'd like to go. You're presented with a random wallpaper to start with. Like the design but not the colors? Swipe right. Like the colors but not the design? Swipe left. Want something completely different? Swipe up. It's pretty fun and a bit addictive.

**Download**: [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003281/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sharpregion.tapet&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) 

### **Doodle** 

Close 

 I'm not much of a live wallpaper guy, but I do appreciate them if they're subtle. Doodle is a collection of live wallpapers from the Pixel 4, Pixel 6, and Chrome OS. These wallpapers come in a variety of colors, they feature very minimal movement, and—the part I like the most—they adjust for dark and light mode to match your phone's theme. I don't use these wallpapers often, but it's a nice change of pace from time to time.

 I'm sure all of this sounds like a lot of work, but it's genuinely something I enjoy. While some people are [playing a quick word game](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-directly-posting-twitvideos-on-whatsapp/) to pass the time, I'm scrolling through wallpapers. Give it a try!

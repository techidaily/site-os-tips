## Part 1: Why you can't add music to iPhone

 There are many factors that lead to you cannot add music to iPhone. The part just discusses the most common situations and provides the top 5 solutions you should know.

### Reason 1: Encode and decode

 Apple not only introduces serious copyright regulations into iOS devices, but also uses a unique file system. If you tend to add music in the formats that iPhone does not support, it will fail without problem. Moreover, you cannot add copy-protected songs to iPhone through iTunes.

Step 1 Before adding music to iTunes library, convert your files to MP3 or AAC.

Step 2 Go to "File" > "Add File to Library" in your iTunes. Connect iPhone to your computer and make sure to update both iOS and iTunes to the latest version.

Step 3 Choose "Songs" from the left sidebar for your iPhone. Drag the music to iPhone that cannot add to iPhone previously.

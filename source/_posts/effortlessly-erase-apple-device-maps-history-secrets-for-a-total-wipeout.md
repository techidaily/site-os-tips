## Part 1: How to delete songs from your iPod touch directly

 If you get an iPod touch, then you are fortunate enough to delete songs from iPod touch directly. Apple offers users two ways to erase iPod music by itself.

### Method one: Delete songs off iPod touch selectively

 Open "Music" App â€“ select "Songs" on the bottom â€“ Check the songs that you want to erase â€“ Slide to left and find the red "Detele" button â€“ tap "Delete" to remove song from iPod one by one.

 In this way, you could erase iPod music without computer, but you have to delete the songs from iPod one by one.

### Method two: Erase all music from iPod quickly

 If you want to delete all songs from iPod touch, then you can try this way. Open "Settings" App on iPod, go to "General", find "Usage", select "Manage Storage", tap "Music". Tap "Edit" on the top right and choose "All Songs". Hit the red "-" icon to delete all the songs when the "Delete" button shows on the right.

 This way allows you to erase all iPod music quickly. But those deleted songs could be recovered with the help of some kind of recovery tools.

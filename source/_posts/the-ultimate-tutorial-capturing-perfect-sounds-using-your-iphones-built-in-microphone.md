 Voice Memos will move your selected recordings to the "Recently Deleted" folder. The recordings will stay here for 30 days after which they will be [permanently removed](https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/n-2024-youtubes-virality-secrets-effective-hashtag-strategies/).

 If you'd like to get rid of your recordings permanently without them staying for another 30 days, then tap the "Recently Deleted" folder on Voice Memos' main screen.

![Tap "Recently Deleted."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/recently-deleted.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 At the bottom-right corner of the "Recently Deleted" screen, tap "Delete."

 If you'd like to restore your deleted audio recordings, then tap the "Recover" option instead.

![Tap the "Delete" button in the bottom right corner.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tap-the-delete-button-again.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Make sure you definitely want to remove the recording, then select "Delete Forever" in the menu that opens at the bottom of the screen. 

 You cannot restore your recordings once they are permanently deleted. Make sure you really want to delete them before tapping "Delete Forever"

![Tap "Delete Forever" when you're sure you want an audio file gone for good.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/delete-forever.png) 

 Your recordings are now deleted.

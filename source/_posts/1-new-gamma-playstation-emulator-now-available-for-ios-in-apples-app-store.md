## 1. New Gamma PlayStation Emulator Now Available for iOS in Apple's App Store!

There are very few consoles that are as iconic as the original PlayStation. The PlayStation 2 was a worldwide phenomenon, but the original console was Sony's first foray into launching a gaming console of its own, and a very memorable one at that. Now, you can relive all those good moments, right on your iPhone, with a new PS1 emulator that just launched on the App Store.

 Gamma is now available on the App Store, bringing PS1 emulation to iPhone users and giving them the ability to relive classics such as _Crash Bandicoot_. This release is notable because it comes from developer ZodTTD. It's a name you might be familiar with if you've installed emulators on your iPhone back when jailbreak was a necessary step to do so. With [the release of Delta](https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/gptzeros-role-spotlight-on-ai-generated-literature/) and Apple's loosening of its longstanding restrictions on emulators, the developer is now free to put out a proper, Apple-approved emulator. Delta already has support for many Nintendo consoles, but now PS1 emulation is readily available.

 What's notable here is that you don't seem to need to go out and find any BIOS files. It's something you need to do for some consoles on Delta, and even with some PS1 emulators as well. The app has both iOS and iPadOS versions, and while you're perfectly free of using on-screen buttons, you also have the option to use a Bluetooth mouse or keyboard if you prefer. It will grab cover artwork for your games automatically, and it will store your game saves and save states on the cloud, either on Google Drive or Dropbox. Pretty nifty.

 We'll have to see whether this is able to catch attention the same way Delta did. Delta has more supported consoles, including massively popular Nintendo consoles. On the other hand, Gamma has one console that Delta doesn't. Delta is working on adding more consoles, however, and it's currently testing Sega Genesis/Mega Drive support.

 It's certainly interesting times for emulation, although we're not sure how far it'll get. As [pointed out by the Dolphin team](https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-supercharge-your-youtube-videos-best-mac-mp4-tools/) recently, Apple still frowns upon Just-in-Time (JIT) recompilers in third-party apps, which will probably be essential to support more powerful consoles. Still, if you want to play some PS1 games, make sure to [check out Gamma now](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gamma-game-emulator/id6499106870).

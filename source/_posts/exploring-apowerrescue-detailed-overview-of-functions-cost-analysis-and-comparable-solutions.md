 What does MMS mean on iPhone? From Wikipedia, MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service), is a standard way to send messages that include multimedia content to and from mobile phones over a cellular network. Still confused? For example, it's a very common thing to record friends' wedding party and take beautiful photos during the journey and more with your iPhone, and then you send these files as an attachment to your friends via Messages by tabbing the camera icon to import them. Then the message with messaging text and pictures or short videos is called MMS. Before you send MMS, you need to get appropriate settings to enable MMS to send or receive. SMS keeps more memory information.

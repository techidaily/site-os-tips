## In Search of a Sleek Tablet? Why the iPad Mini Deserves Serious Consideration

### Key Takeaways

* The iPad min is portable, lightweight, and perfect for one-handed use.
* It's also Apple's best eReader since its small size offers a comfortable reading experience in a range of situations.
* The iPad mini is also a notetaking powerhouse, with improved functionality arriving in iPadOS 18.

 With so many tablets on the market today, finding the one that best suits your needs can be difficult. Apple's current iPad lineup has options for any kind of user, but the iPad Mini doesn't get much attention. So here's why I think you should consider the iPad Mini if you're in the market for a new tablet.

##  A Portable and Lightweight Tablet

 The iPad Mini is, as the name suggests, mini. With an 8.3-inch display, it is significantly smaller than its 13- and 11-inch counterparts. The relatively small size is its main selling point in comparison to the other iPads, and it brings a range of benefits.

 My iPad Mini fits in all of my bags, even smaller crossbodies and fanny packs. With the option for cellular, it is a brilliant commuter sidekick, as I can pull it out of my bag and work on projects wherever I am. It is practically weightless, and the attached Apple Pencil makes it a perfect on-the-go productivity machine.

##  Apple's Best eReader

 The iPad Mini's size makes it a perfect eReader. I still find myself in awe that I can read hundreds of books from something that could fit in my back pocket, and Apple's brilliantly designed [Books](https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/in-2024-enhancing-experience-best-audio-sources-for-unpack-videos/) app makes the reading experience incredible every time.

 The tablet is small and light enough that it can be easily held in one hand, and is comfortable enough to be easily used sitting, standing, or when lying in bed. The iPad Mini with an Apple Pencil for highlighting and markups has quickly become my favorite way to read, and if you're going to use your tablet primarily for this purpose, the Mini is the way to go.

##  A Notetaking Powerhouse

 I used my iPad Mini in every single one of my college classes. With so many brilliant [notetaking apps](https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-saving-videos-from-vlc-live-streaming/) available on the App Store, it was perfect for organizing notes and let me avoid needing to carry several notebooks around all the time.

 The Apple Pencil 2 support on the iPad Mini further bolsters its utility as a note-taker, and I never have to worry about it being charged or losing it since it's always attached to the side. With the [release of iPadOS 18](https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/perfect-your-yt-profile-expert-tips-for-channel-descriptors/), notetaking will get even better, including features like Math Notes and handwriting recognition.

 The iPad Mini's size means it always fits comfortably on desks and tables and is great to have sitting next to my laptop to work on projects.

##  Perfect for One-Handed Use

 My biggest gripe with large iPads is my complete inability to type efficiently without a keyboard. My hands are way too small to thumb type, but sitting there and trying to use it like a traditional keyboard gives me even worse results.

 There are many detachable keyboards made specifically for iPads, but it can be a hassle to pull out a whole keyboard to send a response to a text message. The iPad Mini is in that perfect sweet spot size-wise. I can thumb type on my iPad Mini with minimal stretching, making it a true one-handed device. With some adjusting, I can reach all of my apps, and scrolling through social media one-handed is totally doable.

##  Better Than an iPhone for Gaming

 My iPad Mini is my absolute favorite device for mobile gaming. It works great with my favorite Apple Arcade games, like _Cityscapes_ and _Mini Motorways_. The Apple Pencil integration works perfectly for coloring and puzzle games, and makes the experience much more immersive than just tapping. These games work wonderfully on the iPad Mini, as the device is small enough to play them in bed or handheld, but the games have more screen area to work with than a regular iPhone.

 The iPad Mini also works well with a range of Bluetooth controllers. Unfortunately, it doesn't work with my personal favorite, the [telescopic Backbone controller](https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/spotify-keeps-crashing-a-complete-list-of-fixes-you-can-use-on-realme-narzo-n55-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), but I plug it in via USB-C to play games, and it works perfectly fine.

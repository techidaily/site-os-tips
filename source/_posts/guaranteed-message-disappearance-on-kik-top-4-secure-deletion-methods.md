 If you get an iPod touch, then you are fortunate enough to delete songs from iPod touch directly. Apple offers users two ways to erase iPod music by itself.

### Method one: Delete songs off iPod touch selectively

 Open "Music" App – select "Songs" on the bottom – Check the songs that you want to erase – Slide to left and find the red "Detele" button – tap "Delete" to remove song from iPod one by one.

 In this way, you could erase iPod music without computer, but you have to delete the songs from iPod one by one.

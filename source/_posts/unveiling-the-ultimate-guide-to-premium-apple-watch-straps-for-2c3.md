##  What to Look for in an Apple Watch Band in 2023

 When Apple first released the [Apple Watch](https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/ddpai-mini3-dashcam-a-surprisingly-entertaining-journey-on-the-roads/) in 2015, finding replaceable watch bands that fit everyone's style and needs was difficult. Nowadays, bands are a dime a dozen, with hundreds of third-party options available. However, sifting through that pile of straps can be a hassle, and it's important to know what to look for to separate the good from the cheap.

 For instance, some third-party bands don't fit in the slots on your Apple Watch as well as Apple's first-party straps, so they can protrude and potentially malfunction as a result. Then there's the trouble of spotting the right materials. While bands are inexpensive nowadays, that doesn't mean they're all good. Some might look good, but offer poor construction and cheap parts when you unwrap them.

 Getting the right size is also important. Over the years, Apple has made it a little bit confusing when it comes to picking a band that fits your Apple Watch. In 2018, the company switched from 38mm and 42mm case sizes to 40mm and 44mm cases. Despite this, all bands designed for smaller Apple Watches will continue to fit generation over generation, while those designed for the larger model will also fit.

 Apple made a similar change in the fall of 2021 with the announcement of the Series 7 Apple Watch. This time, the smaller watch size uses 41mm watch bands while the larger model uses 45mm. Like the previous change, the smallest case size of any series will work with the smaller watch band, and the largest model will fit the larger watch band.

 It's also worth remembering that not all bands are for everyone. You can use an Apple Watch in many different ways, so it's important to shop for a band that can strike a balance and accommodate every task and activity you'll perform while wearing it. Those using the smartwatch for fitness will want a material that is easy to clean and doesn't aggravate while sweating, while those mainly wearing their Apple Watch in the office would prefer a band that compliments their office wear more.

 Finally, if you picked up an [Apple Watch Ultra](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cellular-Smartwatch-Precision-Extra-Long/dp/B0CHX7C4CL?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208944&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F750136%2Fthe-best-apple-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), the newest and most rugged line of the series, you'll likely want an even more durable line of bands to use with the smartwatch. Check out our roundup of the [best Apple Watch Ultra bands](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-the-social-lift-transform-from-zero-to-millionth-follower-in-months/) to get you started.

Apple

| Pros                                                      | Cons                                |

 Apple's collaboration with Nike has resulted in various excellent bands for virtually [any fitness activity](https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-12-html5-videophones-for-optimal-viewing/). If you're a runner or enjoy a good jog around the neighborhood, we recommend checking out the [Nike Sport Band](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUUL3AM/A/41mm-pure-platinum-nike-sport-band-m-l).

 This band is made of a lightweight fluoroelastomer (a.k.a. silky-smooth rubber) and features lots of perforations that make the band breathable to wick away sweat. The holes also provide many secure points to ensure your Apple Watch fits properly. Speaking of fitting, it's available for both the 41mm and 45mm Apple Watch case sizes.

 The Sport Band is priced at $49 and comes in different colorways like [Magic Ember](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUUY3AM/A/41mm-magic-ember-nike-sport-band-m-l), [Midnight Sky](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUUP3AM/A/41mm-midnight-sky-nike-sport-band-m-l), [Pure Platinum](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUUL3AM/A/41mm-pure-platinum-nike-sport-band-m-l), [Desert Stone](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUUR3AM/A/41mm-desert-stone-nike-sport-band-m-l), [Cargo Khaki](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUUW3AM/A/41mm-cargo-khaki-nike-sport-band-m-l), and [Blue Flame](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUUU3AM/A/41mm-blue-flame-nike-sport-band-m-l).

##  Best Apple Watch Band for Weight Lifting: [Nike Sport Loop](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTL03AM/A/41mm-bright-green-blue-nike-sport-loop) 

![Nike Sport Loop Band on gradient background](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nike-sport-loop-band.jpg) 

Apple

| Pros                                       | Cons                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Very lightweight, breathable material      | Fabric look might not be for everyone |
| Soft and flexible to move with your wrists |                                       |
| Reliable, secure fit                       |                                       |

 Another great option in Apple's Nike collection is the [Nike Sport Loop](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTL03AM/A/41mm-bright-green-blue-nike-sport-loop). We recommend this one for weight-lifting and other activities that involve stretching your wrists at the gym. This Apple Watch band is made of soft breathable yarn and is extremely lightweight with a bold pattern. It doesn't feel like you're wearing anything at all, even when you're curling those dumbbells.

 The Nike Sport Loop uses a hook-and-loop fastener and a woven pull tab for a secure fit and is easy to wash, both important when sweating at the gym. Its double-layer nylon weave cushions the skin and lets out sweat.

 It comes in 41mm and 45mm sizes and is available in [Starlight/Pink](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUJW3AM/A/41mm-starlight-pink-nike-sport-loop), [Bright Green/Blue](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTL03AM/A/41mm-bright-green-blue-nike-sport-loop), [Black Blue](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUJV3AM/A/41mm-black-blue-nike-sport-loop), [Sequoia/Orange](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTL33AM/A/41mm-sequoia-orange-nike-sport-loop), and [Game Royal/Orange](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTL23AM/A/41mm-game-royal-orange-nike-sport-loop). Priced at $49, it will be a great addition to your gym gear lineup.

Apple

| Pros                                            | Cons               |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Soft material won't bother your skin underwater | On the pricey side |
| You can find an option for any Apple Watch      |                    |
| Minimalist but stylish look                     |                    |

 Choosing the right band for your Apple Watch isn't easy, but it's especially difficult if you're looking for a band that works as well underwater as it does on dry land. Fortunately, Apple had this in mind, as the [Apple Sport Band](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDJ3C2DR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208944&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F750136%2Fthe-best-apple-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is a fantastic watch band for swimmers.

 While the Apple Sport Band looks like it's made out of silicone, Apple claims it's a custom high-performance fluoroelastomer that is softer. This material works well underwater, and it dries quickly once you hop out. It's also available in [41mm](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHZK125?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208944&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F750136%2Fthe-best-apple-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) and [45mm](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHZQRJN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208944&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F750136%2Fthe-best-apple-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) varieties that will fit your watch regardless of your model.

 You've got plenty of color options for this band as well. It's available in [White](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDJ3C2DR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208944&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F750136%2Fthe-best-apple-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [PRODUCT(RED)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHQDDQJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208944&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F750136%2Fthe-best-apple-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [Elderberry](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHSZC7J?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208944&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F750136%2Fthe-best-apple-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [Midnight](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDJ3FFW1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208944&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F750136%2Fthe-best-apple-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [Slate Blue](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHTSKD3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208944&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F750136%2Fthe-best-apple-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [Starlight](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHZKRXM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208944&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F750136%2Fthe-best-apple-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), and [Succulent](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHZJXQZ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208944&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F750136%2Fthe-best-apple-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 The Apple Sport Band is a great pick for swimmers, but it is on the pricey side for what it is. If you're looking for this type of watch band but don't want to spend as much, the [TreasureMax Sport Band](https://www.amazon.com/TreasureMax-Sport-Compatible-Apple-Silicone/dp/B095YT928J?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208944&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F750136%2Fthe-best-apple-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) has a similar look and feel at a lower price.

The $349 [Hermes Noir Bridon Single Tour](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTHQ3AM/A/apple-watch-herm%C3%A8s-45mm-noir-bridon-single-tour), in particular, is a stunner with its continuous knit design and hand-braided 3D chevron patterns.

| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Fantastic leather finish and design               | Price is a bit high        |
| Good construction                                 | Very limited color options |
| |  Only available for 45mm and 49mm Apple Watches |                            |

 When it comes to leather accessories, few companies do them as well as Nomad. The company's [Modern Band](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU208944%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fmodern-leather-band-brown-black-hardware-44mm) for Apple Watch is our pick for the best leather strap you can buy.

 Nomad's design and high-quality genuine leather make for a classic, modern, and rustic band. It'll also patina over time as you use it, giving it a unique, worn look.

 It's relatively pricey at $60, and there aren't any colors to pick beyond brown, tan, and black. But it's a great look nonetheless for 45mm and 49mm Apple Watch users. If you have a smaller Apple Watch, you're unfortunately out of luck with this Nomad band, though you can pick up a band that's even more designer, such as the [Hermes Noir Bridon Single Tour](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTHQ3AM/A/apple-watch-herm%C3%A8s-45mm-noir-bridon-single-tour).

 Sensitive skin is an issue for some skin types. It doesn't matter how useful your Apple Watch is if you can't wear it without irritating your skin. If this is a problem with certain watch bands, then the [Apple Sport Loop Band](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MT573AM/A/41mm-cypress-sport-loop) is the watch band for you.

 The Sport Loop uses a double-layer nylon weave and fastens using a hook-and-loop system, making adjusting easy. The fabric is soft and breathable, and the dense loop side of the hook-and-loop that is in contact with your skin has a cushioned feel and doesn't hold moisture.

 When it comes to Apple-made watch bands, the Sport Loop is as affordable as they get. Even better, it's available in various colors such as [Cypress](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MT573AM/A/41mm-cypress-sport-loop), [Winter Blue](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MT583AM/A/41mm-winter-blue-sport-loop), [Midnight](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MT533AM/A/41mm-midnight-sport-loop), [Starlight](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MT553AM/A/41mm-starlight-sport-loop), and [Light Pink](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MT563AM/A/41mm-light-pink-sport-loop). The Sport Loop comes in [41mm](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Band-Tornado-Regular/dp/B09G9J16BK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208944&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F750136%2Fthe-best-apple-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) and [45mm](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Band-Tornado-Regular/dp/B09G91N8M8?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208944&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F750136%2Fthe-best-apple-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) varieties, with an [X-Large](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MT5D3AM/A/45mm-midnight-sport-loop-extra-large) size option for the 45mm model.

| Pros                                             | Cons                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Metal weave design looks stunning                | Mesh design can occasionally snag arm hair |

 Metal watch bands look great but aren't always the most comfortable and can be tough to adjust. The [Apple Milanese Loop](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Band-Milanese-Regular/dp/B0CHXH5JDB?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208944&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F750136%2Fthe-best-apple-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) addresses these issues with a great look, comfort, and wearability you don't often see in metal watch bands.

 The Milanese Loop uses a stainless steel weave instead of big, chunky metal. This gives the band more breathability than expected in a metal watch band. You might think this is thanks to new technology, but this band is based on a design from Milan near the end of the 19th century.

 You don't have to worry about a buckle, either. Instead of the buckle you'd normally see on a metal watch band, the Milanese loop uses a magnetic design. This makes the band infinitely adjustable, so finding a good fit is easier than other metal watch bands.

 The Apple Milanese Loop is available in [41mm](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Band-Milanese-Regular/dp/B0CHXH5JDB?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208944&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F750136%2Fthe-best-apple-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) and [45mm](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Band-Milanese-Graphite/dp/B09G9HMVNC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208944&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F750136%2Fthe-best-apple-watch-bands%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) versions.

### How do I clean my Apple Watch band?

 For leather bands, wipe the band with a lint-free cloth, slightly damp if necessary. The process is similar for other bands, but you can also use mild hypoallergenic soap with these if necessary.

### Are Apple Watches waterproof?

[Apple Watches are water-resistant, but not waterproof](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-superior-mac-screen-recorder-options-not-bandicam/). You can swim with Apple Watch Series 2 models and later, but older models are only splash-resistant. You can scuba dive with the Apple Watch Ultra, but not other models.

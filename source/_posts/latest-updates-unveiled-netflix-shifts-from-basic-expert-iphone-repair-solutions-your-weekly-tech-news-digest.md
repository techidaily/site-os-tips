##  The Other Stuff

 You might remember Nike’s self-lacing Adapt BB shoes that were released in 2019\. Nike just announced that [the shoes are now discontinued](https://www.engadget.com/nike-is-killing-the-app-for-its-futuristic-adapt-bb-sneakers-120039424.html), and the mobile app used for some functionality will be removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The shoes won’t be completely useless without the app, but it’s yet another example of products becoming worse when the connected apps are shut down.

 ChatGPT also had another fun incident this week. For a while, typing “hi” would cause the chatbot to [print out its own instructions](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/chatgpt-just-accidentally-shared-all-of-its-secret-rules-heres-what-we-learned) for communicating with users, as well as guidelines for the DALL-E image generator. Just another day in generative AI world.

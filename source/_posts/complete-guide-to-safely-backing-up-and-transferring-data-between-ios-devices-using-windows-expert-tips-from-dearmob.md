### How to restore iPhone from an encrypted backup file if I forget my passcode?

The backup password you created is stored on your device. If you have encrypted backup file previously using iTunes, the backup password remains the same. If you forget the backup password, you cannot use that encrypted backup file for restoration.

But you can create another backup file without encryption or set a new passcode by removing the current passcode stored on your iPhone: you will have to reset all settings on your device (Settings > Reset > Reset All Settings), which is iOS innate to secure your device data.

### Does DearMob support migration between iPhones running different versions of iOS?

A backup file created from higher iOS version cannot be restored to an iOS device running a lower version. For instance, you cannot restore iOS 13 backup files to an iPhone running on iOS 12.4\. This restriction is iOS-innate.

## Part 1\. What to do with cracked phone screen?

 If you've got a broken phone screen, first you should assess how bad the damage is. You might be able to live with small cracks that don't block your view too much, but larger cracks should probably be dealt with immediately. For example, if the colors on your screen are abnormal or some pixels are no longer displaying, the damage has gone much further than the glass on top and has affected the LCD panel beneath.

 If you cannot live with a broken phone screen and decide to repair it, there are two methods you can try.

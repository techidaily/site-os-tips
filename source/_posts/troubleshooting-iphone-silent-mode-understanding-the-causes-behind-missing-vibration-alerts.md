## Part 1\. What is Virus Alert and Fake Virus Alert

 A virus alert is a message to remind you that there are viruses in your device. You should clean your device to remove those viruses so your system can run successfully. Usually, if you have installed some anti-virus or anti-malware software, a virus alert will be sent from them.

These messages usually fool you into opening links or installing some extra software. Then they will make you let them scan your device. And they will acclaim that some viruses only can be removed by their products. After you buy their product, you will find it useless. And actually, there is any virus on your device.

 There is no perfect 3-in-1 wireless MagSafe charger for an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods. I’m certain of it. But Nomad’s new, revised [Base One Max 3-in-1](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2000211%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fbase-one-max-3-in-1-carbide) charger gets really close. It looks refined and meticulously organized. In person, it was sturdy and impeccably crafted.

 As Apple releases a new iPhone 15, this could be the phone’s new metal and glass throne. There are a few things to be aware of, however, with this Nomad charger.

##  The Shape of This 3-in-1 Charger Is the Same as the 2-in-1

![A side look at the Nomad Base One Max with a watch, phone, and ear buds resting on it](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/b8487bb7-4a3f-4890-bce1-cd84e92738e3.JPG)

 Whether decor integration is important or not, the Base One Max 3-in-1 looks the part. It's able to fit within a luxurious mansion or suburban townhome. It’s made of metal and glass, giving it a weight of 1.66lbs (755g).

 The heavy weight means it won’t slide around when removing a phone or watch. I had no problem blindly reaching for and grabbing my iPhone in the mornings. The charger didn’t shift around on my nightstand’s wood surface.

 Not only does this new Base One Max 3-in-1 resemble the previous model, it’s nearly identical, including the same exterior dimensions. This raises the question: Did this dock need a third, 5W Qi charging spot for AirPods? The answer is arguable. I never need to charge my AirPods every night or every other night. I usually just stick them on the iPhone spot for a few minutes to top them up. Better yet, [AirPods Pro 2](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-show-wi-fi-password-on-vivo-v27-pro-by-drfone-android/) can actually use the watch charger to boost the battery.

 A few tidbits:

* When AirPods were charging, I couldn't get the watch band closed around the case. This will only be a problem for obsessives.
* There's a color-matched 2m USB-C to USB-C cable included in the box, but no wall adapter. A 30W adapter is required.

##  A Flat Design For Some, Not For Others

![a front view of the Nomad Base One Max, empty](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/a7247e69-16b7-4ce7-866e-2c0d1f376ec8.JPG) 

Tyler Hayes / How-To Geek

 The flat design on the original Base One Max gave the charger a minimal appearance. It wasn’t obtrusive on a nightstand. I imagine it wouldn’t have created much clutter on a desk, either.

 Now, when I see the same flat design, my mind immediately goes to [StandBy mode in iOS 17](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/24-illuminate-your-videos-with-17-lighting-hacks/). The always-on displays on the [iPhone 14 Pro](https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/-up-the-screen-techniques-for-stunning-youtube-visuals/) and, presumably, the [iPhone 15 Pro](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-getting-acquainted-with-picsarts-latest-a-comprehensive-guide-and-review/) will be able to display widgets and clocks while they’re mounted horizontally on a MagSafe charger. This new Base One Max charger won’t facilitate that feature while the phone charges flat on its back.

 I’ve used StandBy mode with the beta iPhone software but haven't employed it full-time yet. I can't say whether missing out on it is a dealbreaker. I’m certainly going to use the ambient information mode at my desk and possibly in the kitchen, but it’s still up for debate whether I need it on my nightstand where the Base One Max 3-in-1 has been residing.

 Besides its comparatively premium price, missing out on this new iOS 17 feature is the Base One Max’s biggest downside. In fact, the charger is a slam dunk, a must-buy, without those two considerations.

##  Old Base One Max vs. New Base One Max

 This new wireless charger isn’t a radical departure from the previous model. That’s a good thing. The overall footprint didn’t even have to grow to accommodate a third charging space. There’s simply a new visual divot to indicate where AirPods should sit.

 One difference between the old model and the new one is the weight.

* New weight: 755g
* Old weight: 900g

 This doesn't matter. In a blind test, I could probably tell the difference, but I didn't notice in general. It didn’t make any functional difference. The heavier one didn’t stay seated any better than the other one. The lighter one also didn’t lift up any more than the heavier one.

##  Should You Buy the Nomad Base One Max 3-in-1 Charger?

 The build quality and design layout of the [Nomad Base One Max 3-in-1](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2000211%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fbase-one-max-3-in-1-carbide) are the main strengths of the wireless charger. The two things that make the buying decision more difficult are price and iOS 17’s StandBy mode.

 Each person will have to figure out how much money they’re comfortable spending on a phone dock. But if $170 is in the budget, I think this investment should last a long time. Just be aware that you won’t see StandBy’s clocks or widgets while the phone is resting on its MagSafe pad.

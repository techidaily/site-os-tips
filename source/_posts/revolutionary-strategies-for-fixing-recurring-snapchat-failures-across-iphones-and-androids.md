## Part 1\. Why Are My Messages Not Sending - 7 Real Reasons Behind This Problem

 As we did some research, there are seven reasons why my messages are not sending, and we have listed them below for you to read. Knowing the problem can hint at what solution we should use to fix it.

### 1\. Internet or Signal Problem

 One of the main culprits, why messages are failing to be sent is an internet or signal problem. Online messaging application needs an internet connection to send a message to the recipients successfully. But if you want to send a message to others using the built-in option, you must have a sim card and cellular data.

### 2\. App Glitches

### 3\. The Recipient’s Phone is Turned Off or Out of Coverage

 It may not be about you; sometimes, the recipient's phone can be off, or they could be in a place without network access. The messages will only be delivered once their device is connected and active.

### 4\. Large Message Size and Media Attachments

 Large messages or media files, such as high-resolution photos and movies, might exceed the file size restrictions set by your messaging app or network provider. Determining the file size and using different sharing techniques for more extensive media can solve the problem.

### 5\. Contact Blocking or Restricted

 A particular contact may have blocked or put you under message restriction if you cannot send messages to them. If that's the case, confirming it with them is crucial.

### 3\. Update the Messaging App

 Outdated messaging apps can lead to text messages not sending. When it requires you to update it, you must update the application or your device to the latest version to get the newly updated version with fix bugs and glitches.

### 4\. Clear App Cache

### 5\. Confirm Recipient’s Status

 If a message fails to send to a specific contact, then there might be a problem on their end. For example, if your number is blocked on their device, you can still send messages but not on an app, yet the recipient cannot see it. To solve this problem, you can ask the recipients if they have inadvertently blocked your number.

### 6\. Restart Your Device

 Why are my messages not sent to one person? It may be due to an error only on our device, so you will need to resolve this immediately with a simple restart. A simple device restart can resolve various software-related issues.

## Download the Latest iOS 17.5 Update: Release Information and Features for iPhones

Apple is being forced to step down from some of its long-standing restrictions thanks to new European Union regulations. A big catch, however, is that most of these changes only apply to devices in Europe. Apple has just released the latest version of iOS, iOS 17.5, and it's a minor update for everyone _except_ European users.

 Apple has just launched the release of iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5, and both software updates are now being rolled out to iPhone and iPad users around the world. The update has a few changes, such as a new offline mode for Apple News+, which will basically pre-load your Today feed and your News+ tab so that you can read through it even if you happen to have no Internet connection. There are also a new "Quartiles" game in Apple News+, which is a spelling game that dares players to form words by selecting tiles with syllables. Apple News+ also has a new scoreboard function for all the mini-games that have been added to the app, including the new Quartiles.

 The update includes a new cross-platform tracking detection feature that will alert you of trackers that are moving with you, even ones created and managed from Android devices (Google's Find My Device network [finally went live in April](https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/revamp-your-social-media-presence-essential-online-image-makers-for-fb-covers/)). This seems to be the final step in Google and Apple's cross-ecosystem tracking integration.

 The biggest improvement in this release, however, is not available outside of the European Union. iOS 17.5 will now allow you to download and install apps from developers' websites, bypassing App Store distribution completely, if you're in Europe. Microsoft announced recently that it is [building an Xbox store for iPhone and Android](https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/solutions-to-spy-on-apple-iphone-xs-max-with-and-without-jailbreak-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/), and the [SetApp store](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-access-your-apple-iphone-15-when-you-forget-the-passcode-drfone-by-drfone-ios/) already went live. It's a bummer that Apple is refusing to roll out these features to US users, [and it's not the first time it happens](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-masterclass-softening-auditory-peaks-gently-in-logic-pro/), but Apple doesn't seem willing to roll out that choice to more regions until it's forced.

 iOS 17.5 is now rolling out to iPhones, so make sure to keep an eye out for an update to your phone coming soon. If you don't see it just yet, it might take a few days for it to land on your phone.

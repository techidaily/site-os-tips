##  What to Look For in an iPhone 15 Case in 2023

 If you’re planning on trying to reuse your iPhone 14 case on the iPhone 15, you’re out of luck. The design of the newer model is too different for older cases to work, so you’ll need a case that is explicitly meant for use with the iPhone 15.

 One of the first choices you’ll have to make for a new case is the form factor. Many people want a simple bumper design that protects the phone during falls, and that’s it. On the other hand, a wallet-style case helps to hold your cards and cash, while folio-style designs include a front flap that provides extra protection for the screen.

 The material is also an important consideration. While plastic and rubber are the most common, you’ll also see leather, cloth, and other materials used. Your decision of material impacts how much the case protects against damage, as well as how it looks.

 You’ll also want to think about where and how you’ll use your phone. Standard cases are enough for most people, but if you’re frequently using your phone in areas where it’s more susceptible to damage, you may want to opt for a rugged case. This offers more protection at the expense of a bulkier design.

 Finally, you need to consider whether [MagSafe](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-achieving-broadcast-excellence-your-guide-to-youtubes-live-360-videos/) support is essential to you. Many cases are compatible with MagSafe charging, but bulkier cases and leather cases don’t always support this feature, so it’s important to check before buying if this is a key feature.

| Pros                                                  | Cons                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| MagSafe compatibility                                 | Completely covers your phone's finish |
| Great protection with Spigen's Air Cushion technology | Limited color options                 |
| Inexpensive                                           |                                       |

 The thing about phone cases is that, while they're an important accessory for most, you don't always need to pay for superior protection. Spigen has been in the case-making business for a while now, and the company is well-known for having quality cases that don't break the bank. The [Spigen Mag Armor MagFit case](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Magnetic-Military-Grade-Protection-Compatible/dp/B0C5S9WKXL?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000361&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the best you can pick up for your iPhone 15.

 This Spigen TPU case has the company's Air Cushion technology, which helps absorb shocks from falls—though the textured back helps ensure you don't drop it in the first place. As the name implies, the Mag Armor case also has MagSafe magnets built in, so you can use MagSafe to charge wirelessly, use accessories, and more.

 For right around $20, the Mag Armor MagFit case is a great deal. But, the chevron texture may not be for everyone, and there are only two color options available: [Matte Black](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Magnetic-Military-Grade-Protection-Compatible/dp/B0C5S97CNR?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000361&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [Navy Blue](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Magnetic-Military-Grade-Protection-Compatible/dp/B0C5S9WKXL?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000361&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). If you're alright with the design, though, you'll end up with a fantastic case for your iPhone.

 If you’ve just bought a new phone, you may not be particularly excited about spending even more money on a case to protect it. The good news is that you don’t need to spend much to get a quality case. The [Spigen Liquid Air Armor Designed for iPhone 15 Case](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Armor-Designed-iPhone/dp/B0C5S9WV88/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000361&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offers plenty of support for your phone without costing more than needed.

 This looks like a simple design, and it is, but that doesn’t mean that the case doesn’t still have a few tricks up its sleeve. The Liquid Air Armor line uses Spigen’s Air Cushion technology to provide a softer landing for your phone in the case of a drop. The case uses an anti-slip matte finish to keep drops from happening in the first place.

 The case supports wireless charging but doesn’t feature MagSafe magnets. Raised bezels around the screen and camera keep them safe when you put your phone down. The case is available in Matte Black, [Abyss Green](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5S7YCV7/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000361&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [Navy Blue](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5S8QNVB/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000361&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) color varieties.

 Who needs to carry a wallet when you’re already carrying your phone? While many wallet cases use a folio-style design that adds significant bulk, that isn’t the only option. The [Smartish Wallet Slayer Vol. 1 for iPhone 15](https://www.amazon.com/Smartish-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Wallet-Case-Credit-Card-Holder/dp/B0C7HKJYMC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000361&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) keeps your cards and cash on the back, leaving access to your screen unobstructed.

 The Wallet Slayer features slots for three cards plus cash on the back, cutting down on bulk. To ensure you can get your cards back out, the case features a thumb slot to help push the cards back out. With no front flap and an unobstructed charging slot, this is more minimal than a typical wallet case but still offers plenty of protection.

 Smartish says the case is drop-tested up to 50 feet, but you probably don’t want to drop your phone that far to test it. The Wallet Slayer is available in three color options: Black Tie Affair, [Blues on the Green](https://www.amazon.com/Smartish-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Wallet-Case-Credit-Card-Holder/dp/B0C7HKRBNX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000361&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [You’re Just Jelly](https://www.amazon.com/Smartish-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Wallet-Case-Credit-Card-Holder/dp/B0C7HHKSH9?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000361&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

| Pros                                           | Cons                            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Five layers of protection keep your phone safe | Bulky design isn't for everyone |
| Raised bezels protect camera and screen        | No MagSafe support              |
| Supports wireless charging                     |                                 |

 If you’re constantly using your phone for measurements on job sites, or you tend to take trips in the great outdoors, you probably need more protection than your average case provides. When you’re looking for the toughest you can get, the [Urban Armor Gear Monarch for iPhone 15](https://www.amazon.com/URBAN-ARMOR-GEAR-Compatible-Protective/dp/B0CCKR59LM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000361&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a fantastic choice.

 The case uses a [thermoplastic polyurethane](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-steamvr-issues-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide/) (TPU) frame, wrapping the iPhone 15 in a softer material for shock absorption. On the outside, a rigid plastic composite backplate offers tougher protection for flat drops, but these are just two of the five layers of protection here.

 Sculpted corners protect from fall damage, while raised areas around the screen and camera lenses protect the glass. This adds up to significant protection, and the case is drop-tested up to 20 feet.

 While the Monarch for iPhone 15 supports third-party wireless chargers, Urban Armor Gear does not mention MagSafe support, so keep that in mind. The case is available in Kevlar Black and [Carbon Fiber](https://www.amazon.com/URBAN-ARMOR-GEAR-Compatible-Protective/dp/B0CDKN58V4?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000361&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) color schemes.

 If you like the uncovered look of your phone but don’t quite want to roll [caseless](https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/unleashing-the-full-potential-of-game-characters-with-voice-alteration-strategies-free/), a clear case is the perfect option. There are plenty of great clear case choices, and cases don’t yellow nearly as much as they used to, but you can’t go wrong with the [Spigen Liquid Crystal](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Crystal-Designed-iPhone/dp/B0C5S7JRS6/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000361&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 In addition to being clear, the Spigen Liquid Crystal case is fairly slim, giving your phone a look close to its original appearance. The case is made from anti-slip TPU, which is easy to install, protects your phone during falls, and doesn’t add much weight or bulk. The case is a single layer, which keeps it easy to install.

 You might think a clear case wouldn’t have any options for the look, but you’d be wrong in this case. In addition to the standard clear option, you can choose from [Crystal Quartz](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Crystal-Designed-iPhone/dp/B0C5SBB192/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000361&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Gradation Pink](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Crystal-Designed-iPhone/dp/B0C5S8ZKKP/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000361&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [Rose Quartz](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Crystal-Designed-iPhone/dp/B0C5S9WG9S/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000361&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), all of which lightly augment your phone’s look while still letting it shine through.

 If you like a svelte feel in your pocket, but don’t want to opt out of using a case, a thin case is your next best bet.

 As the name implies, this case is MagSafe compatible. TORRAS says the case uses 38 pieces of N56 super-strong magnets for a good hold, and that the magnetic ring will never fall off or crack. The case is also compatible with wireless [Qi charging](https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mac-users-download-vllo-and-find-alternative-solutions/), so you can charge it however you like.

 The case uses a special coating for a textured grip, making it tougher to lose your grasp on the phone. You’ll find a pair of raised bezels—1mm for the screen and 1.2mm for the camera lens—to protect your phone’s glass elements. The case is available in Black, Blue, and Green color options.

 Now that Apple no longer makes leather cases, someone else has to take up the mantle. There are many options, but case manufacturer Nomad consistently makes some of the best. If you’re looking for a leather case for your iPhone 15, you’d be hard-pressed to do better than the [Nomad Modern Leather Case](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2000361%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fmodern-leather-case-black-iphone-15).

 Nomad turned to Danish leather tannery [Ecco](https://eccoleather.com/) for the leather used in the case, but this isn’t the only material it uses. It also includes a TPU bumper to give the corners extra protection in case of an accidental drop. Don’t worry about being unable to charge, as the Modern Leather Case fully supports MagSafe charging.

 If you’re worried about dropping your phone, a lanyard-style wrist strap is available as an add-on for an extra $15\. The Nomad Modern Leather Case comes in standard and [folio-style designs](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2000361%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fmodern-leather-folio-black-iphone-15), and is available in Black, [Brown](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2000361%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fmodern-leather-case-brown-iphone-15), and [English Tan](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2000361%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fmodern-leather-case-english-tan-iphone-15) color varieties.

## FAQ

### Can I use my iPhone 14 case with the iPhone 15? 

 No. The design of the two phones is too different, so a case designed for one will not fit the other.

### Can I use an iPhone 15 Pro case with the iPhone 15?

 No. The camera design on the back of the iPhone 15 Pro is significantly different than the iPhone 15, so the cases are not interchangeable.

### How do I clean my iPhone 15 case?

 This depends on the material, but plastic cases are easy to clean with a microfiber cloth and a few drops of water, with a little soap if necessary. Cloth and leather cases need more care during cleaning.

### Does the iPhone 15 support MagSafe?

 Yes. Every model in the iPhone 15 lineup supports MagSafe.

### Can I use a Lightning cable with my iPhone 15?

 No. You’ll need to use a USB-C cable to charge or connect your iPhone 15.

## 1\. What is iPhone jailbreak?

 Jailbreak an iPhone means to remove the restriction and limitations imposed by Apple.

**Is jailbreak same as unlock** ? No. When you unlock an iPhone, it means that you can choose which carrier (AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon, etc.) you would like to use, no matter which one you bought your iPhone from. But you can still run officially iOS software, and that's why you will see many "unlock iPhone without jailbreak" tutorials online. On the other hand, if you jailbreak iPhone, it would better unlock iPhone to other carrier.

## 2\. Why do I want a jailbroken iPhone?

 The following are several reasons why people decide to make iPhone jailbroken. If you have a strong need for one of them, you can consider jailbreaking iPhone.

 1\. With a jailbroken iPhone, you can install third-party applications that are not authorized and available in the App Store.

 2\. Free tethering: tether your Mac to iPhone and bypass your networks' Mobile Hotspot feature, which is often severely restricted and/or expensive.

 3\. Since the OS is entirely open to developers working on jailbroken apps, you can customize iPhone's look and feel to suit your personality, rather than being stuck with the limited options in iOS.

 4\. Unlock your iPhone so you can use it with any carrier, other than the one from which you purchased it.

## 3\. What should I worry about a jail-broken iPhone?

 Although there are so many advantages, it does not mean that there is nothing to worry about a jailbroken iPhone. Before you choose to jailbreak an iPhone 6s/6/5s/5, make sure that you understand the ricks as below.

 1\. A jailborken iPhone may void the warranty you have with your carrier, which means that you can't rely on your carrier or Apple to fix iPhone anymore.

 2\. Every update to iOS will break your jailbroken phone if you decide to update it.

 3\. Jailbreaking your iPhone can take you away from the safety of Apple's "firewall". You can't guarantee that all apps you downloaded outside is completely safe and clean.

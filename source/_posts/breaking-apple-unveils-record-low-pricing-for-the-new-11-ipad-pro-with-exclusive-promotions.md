 The iPad has evolved quite a bit since its humble beginnings as a tablet-sized iPhone. Today, devices like the latest 11-inch [iPad Pro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLF8XC2?tag=htg-v2-5eil11f-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202599&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F874258%2Fapples-11-inch-ipad-pro-drops-back-to-its-lowest-price-ever-plus-more-deals%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) \-- now down to its lowest price yet -- excel at a wide range of tasks, from watching your favorite content on Netflix, to reading a good book on the Kindle app, to even getting some work done (yes, real work). With [Stage Manager](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-instilling-illusions-blur-wonders-in-adobes-visual-staging-tools/), your new iPad can provide a more laptop-like experience with improved multitasking between apps, full mouse and keyboard support, and wide external monitor compatibility.

##  Ecovacs Deebot T8 Robot Vacuum For $438.70 ($211.29 Off)

 Imagine if you could get back all the hours you spend every year manually vacuuming your home. The [Ecovacs Deebot T8](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CSVDHTR?tag=htg-v2-5eil11f-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202599&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F874258%2Fapples-11-inch-ipad-pro-drops-back-to-its-lowest-price-ever-plus-more-deals%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) robot vacuum, now down to the best price of the year so far, can help you do just that. Fully automated, this vacuum uses a precision laser map system to save a floor plan of your home. Then it drives around, sweeping your carpets and mopping your hard floors (bathrooms, kitchens, etc.) with its integrated suction, sweeping, and mopping array. It even detects these surfaces automatically, so you don't have to change any settings yourself. In fact, the only time you'll ever interact with the Ecovacs Deebot T8 is when you empty it, a process you can also automate with the [Deebot Auto-Empty Station](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GHV4YFS?tag=htg-v2-5eil11f-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202599&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F874258%2Fapples-11-inch-ipad-pro-drops-back-to-its-lowest-price-ever-plus-more-deals%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) upgrade (sold separately).

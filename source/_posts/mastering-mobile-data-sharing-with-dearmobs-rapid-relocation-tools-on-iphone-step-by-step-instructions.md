## Using the Transfer Features in DearMob

DearMob iPhone Manager offers users flexible options to transfer iPhone and iPad data.

For instance, some users may prefer a fresh start on a new iPhone, and importing only the photos, excluding other files and system caches. Other users may prefer to move everything to new iPhone.

With [DearMob iPhone Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/iphone-manager/), you can also transfer data from iPhone/iPad to computer, NAS, network path, external hard drives, etc.

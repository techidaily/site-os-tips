### Key Takeaways

* The iPhone 15 has an IP68 rating, meaning it is dust-tight and can be immersed in water for up to 6 meters for 30 minutes.
* Although the iPhone 15 is water-resistant, Apple advises against swimming with it, exposing it to pressurized water, or using it in saunas or steam rooms.

 The new iPhone 15 is another flashy and tech-packed release from Apple, but is the new smartphone waterproof? Can you take it to the beach parties or snap selfies in the pool? Here's what you need to know before heading to the pool deck.

##  iPhone 15 is IP68 Water-Resistant

 First and foremost, it doesn't matter which current generation iPhone you purchase as far as water-resistance is concerned. Apple offers IP68 splash, water, and dust resistance on all models released at the Wonderlust event, [including the vanilla iPhone 15](https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/approved-sound-strategies-tailoring-your-microphone-to-align-with-your-youtube-channel/), the iPhone 15 Plus, the iPhone 15 Pro, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max. That said, here's a breakdown of the IP68 rating, what it means, and what you should and shouldn't do with your pristine brand-new iPhone.

 The most important thing you need to know about your iPhone 15 is that it's not entirely waterproof. Although the term "waterproof" is used collequially to refer to water-resistant products, they're just that: water-resistant. To determine the extent of water resistance, Apple relies on the industry-standard Ingress Protection rating system, or as you've likely heard them called, IP ratings. These ratings are defined by the International Electrochemical Commission (IEC). They consist of two numbers that indicate the ingress resistance of a device against moisture or other minute particles.

Apple

 The iPhone 15, across the entire lineup, carries an IP68 rating. The number "6" indicates that the smartphone is dust-tight and resists damage due to the ingress of particles like dirt or dust. The second number, "8" indicates that the device can survive the effects of immersion underwater for an extended duration. Per the official specifications page, the iPhone 15 series can survive submersion to a maximum depth of six meters for up to 30 minutes.

##  What Does That Mean in the Real World?

 For day-to-day usage, your iPhone should be able to survive accidental drops in the sink, a water bucket, a shallow pool, or if your friend decides to toss a water balloon at you. Even so, you should take the required precautions if you end up exposing the device to liquids. The first thing that Apple recommends is unplugging all the cables. You can tap the iPhone against your hand to remove excess water in the ports. Wiping off the moisture with a lint-free microfiber cloth is also a good way to dry your phone off. Don't put your phone in rice or other materials, or expose it to excessive heat in an attempt to dry it, however.

 Even though your iPhone 15 carries an IP68 rating, Apple advises against swimming with your iPhone, exposing it to pressurized water, or using it in a sauna or steam room. You can still click pictures at a pool party without worrying about splashes here and there or use your iPhone to make calls if stuck in the rain. However, you might want to avoid clicking underwater selfies or videos or dropping your iPhone in a pool that's deeper than six meters. You should consider the water-resistance of your iPhone as a protective feature you hope to not use, and not a selling point that implies you can take your phone snorkeling.

 If you insist on doing that, [get a waterproof phone pouch](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-watch-hulu-outside-us-on-motorola-g54-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) for your iPhone as an added layer of protection. Although the iPhone 15 sure offers great water resistance, it is not permanent. Resistance to ingress damage could decrease with regular wear and tear, especially with impacts or hard blows. This is also why you should apply a protective case on your iPhone, as it protects your phone from fall damage and prevents complete exposure to water.

##  How Does the iPhone 15 Water-Resistance Compare to Other Flagship Phones?

 You might be curious how the iPhone 15 lineup stacks up against other flagship phones in terms of water-resistance. Android flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S23 and Pixel 7 series also have an IP68 water and dust resistance rating. The Asus Zenfone 10 also carries an IP68 rating. However, the $599.99 OnePlus 11 offers an IP64 rating, providing resistance against splashes of fresh water. Hence, owners should be extra careful with the device.

 While some of these phones are more affordable than the regular iPhone 15, it's worth noting that in 2023 an IP68 rating is more or less an industry standard for flagship phones, and Apple isn't cutting any corners with it. So if water-resistance is a serious factor in which phone you're considering, know that the level of water-resistance is pretty consistent across flagship phones.

## Apple AI Innovation: Exclusive Preview and Demonstration

Apple Intelligence is finally here! Well, kinda.  
  
 Today we're getting out first hands-on look at the future of AI on iPhone thanks to the freshly-launched iOS 18.1 beta. There are plenty of hoops to jump through to play with this early version of Apple's built-in AI toys, but we've done the hard work for you.  
  
 As usual, Apple wasn't first to AI on smartphones, or on the desktop for that matter. You can definitely pick out some of these features and say Google was there first. But the next battleground for computing platforms is going to be all about building AI into the OS at a deep level, and Apple's made a solid start based on what we can see in the first beta.

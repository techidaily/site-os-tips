## Charge Multiple Gadgets Simultaneously with Belkin's Latest 200W USB-C Portable Power Station

There's no shortage of USB Type-C wall chargers with multiple ports, but only a few have enough power to power up multiple larger devices at once. Belkin just revealed a new option at CES 2024 with four ports and a maximum output of 200W.

 The Belkin BoostCharge Pro 4-Port USB-C GaN Charger 200W (great name, I know) is a large wall charger with a detachable 5 ft (1.5m) AC power cord. It can charge up to four devices simultanouslyâ€”Belkin says it can get an iPhone 15 Pro from 0 to 50% in 21 minutes, and 0 to 50% for a MacBook Pro 16" in 30 minutes. The ports are all USB Type-C, so if you wanted to connect some devices with fixed Type-A connections (like many smartwatch power adapters), you would need [a USB C-to-A adapter](https://amazon.com/dp/B01GGKYYT0?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001461&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbelkin-200w-4-port-charger-ces-2024%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 Just like most other multi-port chargers, the exact power output varies based on how many devices are connected and what the power requirements are for each one. It can push a maximum of 140W over a single port, with other ports sharing the remaining 60W (hence 200W in the name). That would allow you to to power nearly any USB-C laptop while also fast charging a smartphone or tablet. You could also plug in several devices with lower maximum charging speeds, like smartphones and smartwatches, and they would all charge at a rapid speed.

 The charger is also compact for its charging capacity, measuring only 92mm x 118.5mm x 35.5mm and weighing 650g/1.32lbs. It's designed to fit on top of tables and desks, giving you easy access to the ports without reaching down to the wall outlet.

 The BoostCharge Pro supports USB Power Delivery 3.1 (USB-PD) and PPS, so it supports the fastest available charging speeds for devices like the iPhone 15, Samsung Galaxy S series, Apple MacBook and MacBook Pro, USB-C iPad models, and more.

 The Belkin BoostCharge Pro 4-Port 200W charger will be available in March 2024, and it will cost $130\. It will be available from [Belkin's website](https://www.belkin.com/) and major retailers. That's around the same price as the competition, including the [Satechi six-port charger](https://amazon.com/dp/B0BXBQL713?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001461&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbelkin-200w-4-port-charger-ces-2024%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) (which has two additional USB-C ports) and [UGREEN's six-port charger](https://amazon.com/dp/B09MGRNYHH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001461&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbelkin-200w-4-port-charger-ces-2024%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) (with two USB Type-A ports).

## Amazed by My Experience with AirPods Pro 2: The Incredible Upgrade

I've owned the first-generation AirPods Pro since launch and always been incredibly pleased with them. I was so pleased, I never considered upgrading to the AirPods Pro 2 because I didn't think there was anything to improve upon. Now I realize how wrong I was, just in time for a Prime Day sale.

##  The Difference in Active Noise Cancelation Is Night and Day

 My favorite feature of AirPods Pro is the [Active Noise Cancelation (ANC)](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-sharing-twitch-on-your-fb-page-for-2024/). With it enabled, I can listen to music, podcasts, or videos at a comfortable volume whether I'm beside a busy road, vacuuming, cooking, or in any other kind of noisy environment.

 The ANC on the first-generation AirPods Pro was never perfect—I could always hear some background noise—but it made a big enough difference for me. I never struggled to hear whatever media was playing and I figured it was as good as anyone could expect.

 Well, my opinion changed when I borrowed my partner's AirPods Pro 2 the other day. Upon enabling ANC all the background noise in my environment absolutely vanished. It was more silence than I'd experienced in a long time, and I live in the countryside.

 Improved ANC was one of the flagship features when the AirPods Pro 2 came out, and our own [AirPods Pro 2 review](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-show-wi-fi-password-on-vivo-v27-pro-by-drfone-android/) commented on the dramatic improvement. But I never thought it would be that big of a difference; I never thought I'd care. Well, now I've experienced it for myself, I'm struggling to go back.

##  There's No Better Time to Grab Some AirPods Pro 2

 Despite being happy enough with my original AirPods Pro, I'm now seriously considering upgrading to the second generation. Not only will I get to regularly use the improved ANC that so impressed me, but I'll get refreshed battery life, better volume controls, and a wireless charging case. And it just so happens that the AirPods Pro 2 are on offer with Prime Day right now.

 At the time of writing, you can grab the [AirPods Pro 2](https://amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) for $168.99, which is a big drop from the $249 sticker price and better than any other deals I've seen throughout the year.

 They're definitely worth checking out if you're an Apple user in the market for some headphones—or an original AirPods Pro owner curious about how much better it could be.

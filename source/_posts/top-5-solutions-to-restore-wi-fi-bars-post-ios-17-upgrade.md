### Reason 1: Encode and decode

 Apple not only introduces serious copyright regulations into iOS devices, but also uses a unique file system. If you tend to add music in the formats that iPhone does not support, it will fail without problem. Moreover, you cannot add copy-protected songs to iPhone through iTunes.

Step 1 Before adding music to iTunes library, convert your files to MP3 or AAC.

Step 2 Go to "File" > "Add File to Library" in your iTunes. Connect iPhone to your computer and make sure to update both iOS and iTunes to the latest version.

Step 3 Choose "Songs" from the left sidebar for your iPhone. Drag the music to iPhone that cannot add to iPhone previously.

### Reason 2: iCloud music is enabled

 It is the most possible reason that you cannot add music to iPhone. iCloud music conflicts with iTunes and stops you from adding music to iPhone. Here is the solution you should follow.

Step 1 Go to the "Settings" app on your iPhone, head to "Music" and turn off "iCloud Music Library" if it is enabled.

Step 2 Try to sync music from iTunes to iPhone again to see if the problem is fixed.

Note: In addition to iCloud Music, iTunes Match and Apple Music will cause the problem too. Make sure you have already turned them off as well.

### Reason 3: Set up incorrectly

 Apple keeps introducing new features into iTunes, which makes iTunes setup complicated. For example, iTunes allows users to add music to iPhone through Wi-Fi or USB cable, automatically or manually. You can follow the steps below to add music to iPhone from iTunes manually.

Step 1 Plug iPhone to your computer and wait for iTunes to recognize your device.

Step 2 Open your iTunes, go to the "Summary" tab, check "Manually Manage Music and Videos" and uncheck other options. Click the "Apply" button to confirm it.

Tip: If you check Automatically sync when this iPhone is connected, iTunes music library will overwrite music files in your iPhone once you plug your iPhone to the computer.

Step 3 Click the "Music" option in the library area in the upper left corner. Now, you will be presented all music in your iTunes library, press Ctrl button on Windows or Command button on Mac and select the desired songs.

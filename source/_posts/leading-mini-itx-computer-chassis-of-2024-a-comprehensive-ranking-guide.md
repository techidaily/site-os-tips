* We've reviewed our recommendations and updated our pick for the best Mini-ITX case overall.

 Desktop PCs offer advantages over laptops, but full tower builds can take up too much space. Instead, why not build a powerful PC in a much smaller form factor with a Mini ITX case?

 We've reviewed our recommendations and updated our pick for the best Mini-ITX case overall.

##  Buying a Mini ITX Case in 2024

 While [Mini ITX](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-ultimate-guide-to-catch-the-regional-located-pokemon-for-oppo-reno-9a-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) cases fit in places most computers can't and are more portable overall, you can still make various PC builds work in this form factor. That said, there are a few things you'll want to keep in mind when shopping for a Mini ITX case.

 The most obvious issue is your motherboard. Mini ITX cases only work with Mini ITX motherboards, so if you already own a motherboard you intend to use, double-check its form factor before buying a case. You can fit Mini ITX motherboards in larger cases, but not vice versa.

 Another major consideration is what you'll use the PC for and how heavy the workload will be. If you're [building a Mini ITX gaming PC](https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-stitch-together-photographs-the-montage-masterclass/) or video editing rig, and you're planning on air cooling, ensure the case has good enough airflow to keep everything cool.

 Speaking of cooling, you'll also need to think about fan clearance. If you plan on using a liquid cooling setup, you also need to ensure the case has enough room to fit the reservoir inside the case with adequate clearance. Even larger Mini ITX cases are smaller than their bigger siblings, so you don't need to worry about too large a footprint.

 If you're not planning on integrated graphics, you'll also have to consider the graphics card you'll use in your build. While some cases can fit even triple-slot GPUs, not all of them do, so make sure to think about possible future upgrades. Also note the length of the GPU, as different cases support different max lengths for graphics cards.

 Finally, if you haven't already bought a power supply, you should consider whether you want to buy a case with an included power supply. These aren't often as high-performance as other power supplies. That said, if you're building a simple home theater PC or a similar type of build, these may do the trick, save you a little money and fit the case well.

 A great mini-ITX case is a combination of a small footprint, great cooling, and solid performance, but that’s easier said than done. Not only does the [Corsair Airflow 2000D Mini PC Case](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BW4N75LD/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228037&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F902782%2Fbest-mini-itx-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) pull it off well, but it’s a case that will work for a wide variety of different use cases and build types.

 Despite the name, the Corsair Airflow 2000D is as equipped for liquid cooling as it is for air cooling. That said, if you’re considering liquid cooling, you should consult Corsair’s 2000D cooler compatibility page. If you opt for air cooling, you can run up to eight 120mm fans.

 Like many Corsair cases, the Airflow 2000D features mesh side panels to help keep air moving. All of these are removable, making access to the internals easier compared to other PC cases. This is a major plus in a Mini ITX case due to the already cramped dimensions.

 The front panel has all the ports you’ll likely need, located near the bottom of the case. On a full tower, this could be a problem, but with the form factor of this case, it’s better suited for a desk, so this location could be handier for most people. You get a pair of USB-A ports, a single USB-C port, and a headphone/mic jack.

 While many people looking at a mini-ITX build are thinking of productivity machines or home theater PCs, they’re becoming increasingly popular for gaming. To that end, the Corsair Airflow 2000D features support for up to three-slot GPUs, and there are plenty of reports of people happily running 4090 cards in this relatively small footprint.

 By default, the Airflow 2000D comes in relatively understated [black](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BW4N75LD/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228037&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F902782%2Fbest-mini-itx-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or [white](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BW4PT5BT/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228037&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F902782%2Fbest-mini-itx-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) finish options. If you prefer a little more color, you can opt for the RGB Airflow model, which is mostly identical except for three preinstalled 120mm RGB fans. The Airflow 2000D RGB is available in [black](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BW4PL5V6/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228037&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F902782%2Fbest-mini-itx-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [white](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BW4QC419/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228037&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F902782%2Fbest-mini-itx-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) options as well.

| Pros                                       | Cons                           |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| ✓ Looks like a game console                | ✗ Only supports AIO cooling    |
| ✓ Built-in handle for easy portability     | ✗ No room for triple-slot GPUs |
| ✓ Every panel is removable for easy access |                                |
| ✓ Good cooling performance                 |                                |

 Regardless of the form factor, PCs tend to look like PCs. If you prefer the look of a game console for your gaming PC, the [Hyte Revolt 3](https://www.amazon.com/HYTE-Revolt-Factor-Premium-Computer/dp/B09HZJHS9C?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228037&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F902782%2Fbest-mini-itx-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a perfect option, bearing a striking resemblance to a major game console. It also has a handle on top, perfect for bringing your gaming rig everywhere.

 Despite its relatively small footprint, the Hyte Revolt 3 offers plenty of access to the internals. This is thanks to the removable panels on each side, letting you access the inside of the PC from any angle. The only major downside is that the case only supports AIO liquid cooling, with no room for fans. However, If you plan on a liquid-cooled build, this won't be a problem.

 While the Revolt 3 doesn't offer room for triple-slot graphics cards, it does support dual-slot GPUs. It also supports longer cards than many Mini ITX cases, with room for cards up to 335 × 140 x 55mm. That's plenty of clearance for running more powerful GPUs.

 The Hyte Revolt 3 is available in [white](https://www.amazon.com/HYTE-Revolt-Factor-Premium-Computer/dp/B09HZJHS9C?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228037&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F902782%2Fbest-mini-itx-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [black](https://www.amazon.com/HYTE-Revolt-Factor-Premium-Computer/dp/B09HZ2NCNT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228037&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F902782%2Fbest-mini-itx-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) color options, and you'll often find the case bundled with a 700-watt power supply as well.

This certainly has something to do with the popularity of the [Cooler Master NR200](https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Triple-Slot-Tool-Free-Accessibility/dp/B08BFJ8V8C?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228037&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F902782%2Fbest-mini-itx-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) case, but it also offers an easy to work with build and plenty of airflow and clearance.

 The company literally based its name on cooling, and this case certainly excels at that, regardless of whether you're going for an air-cooled or water-cooled build. For more traditional air-cooled builds, the NR200 offers room for up to seven fans---more than you'll typically find in this form factor.

 Don't worry if you're planning on a water-cooled build, as the NR200 works well here too. The case offers two locations to mount a cooling pump, while radiator mounting locations are on both the side and bottom of the case. You can access all of these easily, with tool-free removable panels on all sides.

 There are two versions of this case: the NR200 and the [NR200P](https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Triple-Slot-Tool-Free-Accessibility/dp/B08BDWSTG1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228037&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F902782%2Fbest-mini-itx-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). The only difference is the NR200P uses a tempered glass panel instead of the mesh panels found on the NR200\. The Cooler Master NR200 is available in [black](https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Triple-Slot-Tool-Free-Accessibility/dp/B08BFJ8V8C?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228037&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F902782%2Fbest-mini-itx-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or [white](https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Triple-Slot-Tool-Free-Accessibility/dp/B08BFJHP26?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228037&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F902782%2Fbest-mini-itx-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) color options.

Best Mini ITX Case for Cooling

#####  Cooler Master NR200

$83 $110 Save $27 

The Cooler Master NR200 is one of the most flexible cases you can buy, with 360-degree access, great support for both air or liquid cooling, and room for larger graphics cards than most Mini ITX cases.

[$83 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Triple-Slot-Tool-Free-Accessibility/dp/B08BFJ8V8C?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228037&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F902782%2Fbest-mini-itx-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

##  Best Premium Mini ITX Case: [Phanteks Evolv Shift XT](https://www.amazon.com/Phanteks-PH-ES121XT%5FDGS01-Form-Factor-Digital-RGB-Triple-Slot/dp/B09SKLM4L7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228037&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F902782%2Fbest-mini-itx-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

| Pros                                  | Cons                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ✓ Expandable design is super flexible | ✗ Look won't be for everyone |
| ✓ D-RGB lighting effects              |                              |
| ✓ Solid cooling support               |                              |
| ✓ Supports triple-slot GPUs           |                              |

 Every once in a while, you see an interesting new idea in PC case design, but it doesn't happen that often. The [Phanteks Evolv Shift XT](https://www.amazon.com/Phanteks-PH-ES121XT%5FDGS01-Form-Factor-Digital-RGB-Triple-Slot/dp/B09SKLM4L7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228037&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F902782%2Fbest-mini-itx-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a great example, as it uses an expandable design that lets you keep it small for portability or make it taller to increase the clearance for fans or liquid cooling.

 The case starts at just 211mm tall, but you can raise the height by either 30mm or 60mm. Inside, you'll find room for two fans, either 120mm or 140mm in size. If you plan on a water-cooled build, there's room for a 240 AIO liquid cooler.

 This case has plenty of room for powerful hardware despite the small size. This includes triple slot graphics cards, thanks to the built-in PCIe 4.0 x16 riser cable. The case accommodates GPUs up to 324mm in length, so you can fit fairly powerful cards inside.

 One other unique aspect of the case is the included D-RGB infinity mirror to offer built-in lighting effects. The Evolv Shift XT is available in [Silver](https://www.amazon.com/Phanteks-PH-ES121XT%5FDGS01-Form-Factor-Digital-RGB-Triple-Slot/dp/B09SKLM4L7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228037&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F902782%2Fbest-mini-itx-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or [Black](https://www.amazon.com/Phanteks-PH-ES121XT%5FDGS01-Form-Factor-Digital-RGB-Triple-Slot/dp/B09SKLM4L7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228037&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F902782%2Fbest-mini-itx-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) varieties.

Best Premium Mini ITX Case

#####  Phanteks Evolv Shift XT

If you like flexibility, the Phanteks Evolv Shift XT, as it can expand in height to add clearance for improved cooling support. The case also has a unique look and even RGB lighting effects.

[$149 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Phanteks-PH-ES121XT%5FDGS01-Form-Factor-Digital-RGB-Triple-Slot/dp/B09SKLM4L7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228037&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F902782%2Fbest-mini-itx-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

| Pros                                           | Cons                          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| ✓ Good airflow                                 | ✗ Doesn't support larger GPUs |
| ✓ Included 200mm fan                           |                               |
| ✓ Interchangable mesh or tempered glass panels |                               |
| ✓ Very affordable                              |                               |

 A case doesn't have to be flashy or new to make it a great buy. The [Thermaltake Core V1 SPCC Mini ITX Cube](https://www.amazon.com/Thermaltake-Computer-Chassis-Interchangeable-CA-1B8-00S1WN-00/dp/B00M2UKGSM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228037&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F902782%2Fbest-mini-itx-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) has been around for a few years, but it's still a great case from a reputable brand and much more affordable than our other case picks.

 The low price doesn't mean this is a basic case. You'll find several handy touches here, like an adjustable I/O panel location, making port access more convenient, regardless of where you're putting the PC. You can also freely interchange the symmetrical side panels to swap between mesh and tempered glass sides.

 Many Mini ITX cases don't ship with fans, but despite the low price, the Core V1 ships with a 200mm fan preinstalled. Depending on what you're building your PC to do, this could cover all your cooling needs. There is also room for two 80mm fans at the back of the case.

 While this case doesn't fit GPUs as large as some of our other picks, it does support dual slot cards up to 260mm in length. The case doesn't offer 360-degree access, but both side panels and the top panel are removable, giving you plenty of angles to approach from.

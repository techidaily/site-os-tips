## Part 4 . How to Backup iPhone to Computer with Google Drive

 You can also backup iPhone to PC with the help of Google Drive, thus you are able to access iPhone data through Google on PC. But like iTunes, Google Drive will fullly backup your iPhone data. Your iPhone emails, calendars and contacts have been online already.

![Backup iPhone to Computer](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/ios-data-backup-and-restore/backup-iphone-to-google-drive.jpg)

 If you need to backup lots of photos from iPhone to Google Drive, this way will not work well, as only new photos will be backed up. And Google Drive will overwrite your precious backup files like iTunes does, including other data such as contacts and calendars.

## The Myth of Vanishing Apple IDs: What You Need to Know Before It 'Goes Away'

Since its inception, the term "Apple ID" has remained a persistent source of confusion for new iPhone and Mac customers. So, Apple is simplifying things. Starting with the launch of iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, Apple accounts will be called "Apple Accounts." It's very glamorous, I know.

 This is a purely cosmetic rebrand. You don't need to create a new account or memorize a new password. Most users won't even notice that anything has changed, as "Apple Account" is a far more intuitive name than "Apple ID," and people often forget that the latter term even exists.

 While the Apple Account rebrand may have no impact on you as a customer, it's a laborious task for Apple employees. The company needs to replace "Apple ID" across all of its currently-supported products, web pages, legal documents, and marketing materials. The [Apple ID landing page](https://support.apple.com/apple-id) also needs to be redirected to some other URL, presumably support.apple.com/apple-account.

 And Apple isn't the only business that's being put to task. Technology websites like _How-To Geek_ have published an innumerable number of articles that mention "Apple ID." Many of these articles, barring those that are no longer relevant or useful, will need to be updated to reflect the new "Apple Account" branding. (Maybe "need" is too strong a word. Anyway, a small pebble can send ripples across a big pond.)

 I should note that Apple also uses "ID" branding for Face ID and Touch ID. If the company is depreciating this branding in one area, it may be a sign that Face ID and Touch ID will face a similar change. Of course, I see no reason to draw conclusions from such unsubstantiated speculation. It's just a fun thing to think about as we wait for the [iPhone 16](https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-drone-buddies-kids-most-enjoyed-toy-companions/) launch event.

 You'll begin to see the term "Apple Account" when [iOS 18](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-convenient-tutorial-snapchat-installation-macos-style/) and [macOS Sequoia](https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/approved-youtube-editing-essentials-the-ultimate-guide-post-upload-refinements/) launch this fall (probably mid-September). If you have any older family members who refuse to install OS updates, you may want to mention that an Apple ID is the same as an Apple Account, as old OS versions will probably retain the old terminology.

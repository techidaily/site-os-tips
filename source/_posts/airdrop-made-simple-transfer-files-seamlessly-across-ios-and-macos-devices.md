## Part 3\. Why Can’t I Reset Apple ID Password

 There are several reasons why you might be facing difficulties resetting your Apple ID password. This part lists some common culprits.

 Mistyped Apple ID or Email Address: Ensure you are using the correct login information for your Apple ID. Typographical errors in the email address or ID can prevent you from receiving reset instructions.

 Network Problems: A bad internet connection can disrupt the Apple ID password reset process.

 Out-of-date Recovery Information: Ensure your email address and[phone number associated with your Apple ID](https://tools.techidaily.com/) are current. If you have changed them recently, update them on the Apple ID account page before attempting to reset your password.

 Forgotten Security Questions: If you opted for security questions as your secondary recovery method, ensure you remember the answers exactly. Minor variations in spelling or capitalization can lead to unsuccessful attempts.

 Two-Factor Authentication Issues: If two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled, receiving the verification code might be delayed or blocked due to issues with your trusted devices or phone carrier.

 Apple Account Locked: If you have made too many incorrect login attempts, your Apple ID might be temporarily locked. Wait for the specified unlocking period before attempting to reset your password again.

## Part 4\. FAQs of How to Reset Apple ID Password

 If you have enabled iCloud Keychain and have previously accessed your Apple ID password on a trusted device (iPhone, iPad, Mac), you might be able to find it saved there. Also, you can use Aiseesoft[iPhone Password Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/aiseesoft/iphone-password-manager/) to find your Apple ID password with ease.

 Can you log out of the Apple ID account without a password?

 In most cases, you cannot log out of your Apple ID account without a password. Apple prioritizes security and requires password verification to ensure it's the rightful owner making changes to the account.

 What if I entered the wrong Apple ID password too many times?

 After entering the wrong password more than 5 times within a short period, your Apple ID will be temporarily locked in security reasons. It typically lasts for a few hours. During this time, you won't be able to sign into any Apple services or devices using that Apple ID. If you make numerous incorrect passwords attempts after the temporary lockout, your Apple ID might get disabled. That is a more serious situation, and it could take several days to recover your account.

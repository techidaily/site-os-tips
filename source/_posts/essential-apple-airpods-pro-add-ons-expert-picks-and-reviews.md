##  What to Look For in an AirPods Pro Accessory

 The best AirPods Pro accessories improve the experience of using your Apple earbuds. For example, you can use a case to protect your AirPods, buy ear hooks to keep them securely in your ears, try foam tips for a better fit, and so much more.

 But before you go shopping, one of the most important things to consider is compatibility. Apple has released three iterations of the regular [AirPods](https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/resolving-spotify-freeze-issue-in-windows-11-os/) and two of the Pro model. Not every accessory will work with each model. You must ensure that the accessory you buy will work with your new AirPods Pro.

 You must be particularly careful with AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) cases. The AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) charging case has the exact dimensions as the original AirPods Pro. But the AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) charging case has a lanyard loop. Any covers that haven't been specifically designed for the new model will lack a cutout for the loop, rendering it unusable.

 It's also a good idea to check whether an accessory will impact the function of your AirPods. After all, you want an accessory to enhance your experience, not diminish it.

[![Caseology Vault collage](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/caseology-vault-1.jpg) Caseology](https://www.amazon.com/Caseology-Keychain-Carabiner-Included-Generation/dp/B0B75YQ5BL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

| Pros                              | Cons                                     |

| Solid drop and scratch protection | Lid cover uses adhesive to stay in place |
| Bundled carabiner                 | No extra locking mechanism               |
| Enhanced grip                     |                                          |

 The wireless charging case included with the AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) isn't the most durable. It's susceptible to scratches, chipping, and even cracks when dropped. This is where the [Caseology Vault](https://www.amazon.com/Caseology-Keychain-Carabiner-Included-Generation/dp/B0B75YQ5BL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) comes into play. It's a top-notch cover that snuggly fits the AirPods Pro case and protects it from everyday mishaps.

 It's made with TPU material and features a textured finish. There's also a grooved rubberized bumper that runs across the side of the entire case, which ensures a secure grip and provides drop protection.

 In other features, the bundled carabiner allows you to strap the AirPods Pro to a backpack or a belt loop. Plus, there's a cutout to access the original case's lanyard loop if you want to use a strap.

 The case is available in a single [Matte Black](https://www.amazon.com/Caseology-Keychain-Carabiner-Included-Generation/dp/B0B75YQ5BL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) color. But two more options---[Midnight Green](https://www.caseologycases.com/products/vault-6?variant=40045857505354) and [Navy Blue](https://www.caseologycases.com/products/vault-6?variant=40045857538122)\---are expected soon.

 The Caseology Vault is a non-locking AirPods case. This means that your AirPods may fall out if you drop the case. While this may not result in any breakage, your AirPods could get scratched if you're unlucky.

 If you prefer an AirPods Pro case with a lock, the [AirSnap Pro from Twelve South](https://www.amazon.com/Twelve-South-Full-Grain-Protective-Prevention/dp/B081W6VV8V?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a great option. It's made with full-grain leather and features a strong metal snap closure to ensure your AirPods don't fall out. The case was designed for the original AirPods Pro, so it lacks a cutout for the lanyard loop. However, you can use the included D-ring to attach a lanyard.

| Removable clip for size adjustment |                                             |

 For the first time, Apple has included a lanyard loop in the official AirPods Pro case. If you want to make the most of it, [Hukado's lanyard](https://www.amazon.com/Hukado-Adjustable-Flashlight-Keychains-Multi-Color/dp/B07RN4QKVH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an excellent option. Available in two sizes and an assorted mix of colors, the lanyard is made with nylon and features a removable clip to adjust its length.

 The lanyard is durable and perfect for locking the AirPods to your bag or jeans. You can get the lanyards in packs of [six](https://www.amazon.com/Hukado-Adjustable-Flashlight-Keychains-Multi-Color/dp/B07RN4QKVH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [ten](https://www.amazon.com/Hukado-Adjustable-Flashlight-Keychains-Multi-Color/dp/B07WHCS3N6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), or [twenty](https://www.amazon.com/Hukado-Adjustable-Flashlight-Keychains-Multi-Color/dp/B09N97D676?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This means you get plenty of spares to use with your smartphone, camera, keys, USB drives, and more.

 Although Hukado's lanyard has generally glowing reviews from buyers on Amazon, some people have [complained](https://www.amazon.com/Lanyard-Hukado-Adjustable-Wristlet-Keychain/product-reviews/B09N97D676?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) that the length adjustment clip doesn't stay in place for them. If you end up with this issue, you can return them for a refund or replacement.

| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Excellent seal                           | Slightly expensive |
| Low ear fatigue                          |                    |
| Helps with noise cancellation            |                    |
| Doesn't interfere with the charging case |                    |

 Comply has made a name for itself by producing top-notch memory foam tips for various popular in-ear headphones. If you're looking to replace the included silicone tips of your new AirPods, there's no better option than Comply's [Memory Foam Ear Tips](https://www.amazon.com/Comply-Compatible-Earbuds-Small-Pairs/dp/B088KPNKN2?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 Unlike many other foam tips, the Comply ear tips last longer and don't wear down quickly. While you won't notice much difference in sound quality between the original silicone and Comply ear tips, the memory foam tips provide a better seal and can help with noise cancellation. The memory foam ear tips also result in less ear fatigue than their silicone counterparts.

 Additionally, with Comply ear tips, your AirPods will have no trouble fitting in the charging case, even if you use the largest size tips. The Comply ear tips come in three sizes, [small](https://www.amazon.com/Comply-AirPods-Comfortable-Canceling-Charging/dp/B088KQKYSC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [medium](https://www.amazon.com/Comply-AirPods-Comfortable-Canceling-Charging/dp/B088KR36Z7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [large](https://www.amazon.com/Comply-AirPods-Comfortable-Canceling-Charging/dp/B088KQS8T8?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). You can pick [a mix of sizes](https://www.amazon.com/Comply-Compatible-Earbuds-Small-Pairs/dp/B088KPNKN2?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) to test out, or if you know your exact size, you can get a set of three in your size.

 Lastly, at $25, these are not cheap. However, you're getting the gold standard in memory foam ear tips.

Proof Labs

| Pros                              | Cons                               |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Soft and comfortable              | Need to be removed before charging |
| Easy to install and remove        |                                    |
| Add extra grip for more stability |                                    |

 Although the AirPods Pro generally offers an excellent fit, you can purchase the [Proof Labs Ear Hooks Covers](https://www.amazon.com/Proof-Labs-AirPods-Pro-Accessories/dp/B0BN5DXYSP/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) to add extra grip for your running sessions or intense workouts. As the name suggests, these cover each AirPod and add a hook, which looks like a sports fin, to lock them in your ears. As a result, you no longer have to worry about the AirPods Pro falling out of your ears.

 The ear hooks are also well-made, soft, and comfortable, so you don’t feel uneasy wearing them. You get two size options in each pack to account for different ear sizes.

 The only drawback of the Proof Labs Ear Hooks Covers or any other similar product is that you need to remove them before putting the AirPods Pro in its charging case. The AirPods simply won’t fit in the case with these on. While the installation and uninstallation are pretty straightforward and take only a minute, you need to be careful about not losing the ear hooks. Fortunately, the company supplies a storage pouch for the same.

Gogosodu

| Pros                                      | Cons                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Comfortable and easy to apply             | Can’t charge AirPods with the strap |
| Doesn’t interfere with the touch controls |                                     |

 If the AirPods Pro frequently pop out of your ears and you don’t want to get after-market ear tips or hooks for extra grip, you can consider the [GOGOSODU Neck Strap](https://www.amazon.com/GOGOSODU-Compatible-Silicone-Anti-Lost-Connector/dp/B075NCRPJ6/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) to avoid losing them. It’s different from most other neck straps on the market that simply have a silicone cord attaching the two ends that grip the AirPods stems. It features a sturdy neckband portion that doesn’t move around and rests securely around your neck. Moreover, the two ends of the strap slip onto the AirPods Pro stems to hold them tightly.

 The neck strap feels comfortable and is built well. Another positive of the GOGOSODU offering is that it doesn’t interfere with the AirPods Pro touch controls. Unfortunately, like the ear hooks, you must remove the strap while charging the AirPods. But at least the neck strap is easy to apply and remove.

 You can pick from six color options. But the different color variants only have a small part that sports a different color. Otherwise, the rest of the strap remains black in most variants.

 There are many ways to charge the AirPods Pro. For example, you can use a USB port on your computer or your iPhone/MacBook charger. Plus, there's the option of using a regular [Qi wireless charger](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fake-snapchat-location-without-jailbreak-on-vivo-y02t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), a [MagSafe charger](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXH3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08L5NP6NG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), or even the [Apple Watch charger](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Magnetic-Charger-USB-C/dp/B09G9KZV1Q?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). But if you want something made specifically for your AirPods, it's hard to go wrong with this stylish charger from [Wireless Future Charger](https://www.amazon.com/Designed-Practical-Accessories-Wireless-Compatible/dp/B088BFKX85?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 It's a nifty little option that charges your earbuds safely. And the perfectly sized cradle ensures you don't have to worry about positioning the AirPods Pro case. Instead, the case slides into the groove for perfect placement.

 The charger's design doesn't take up much space, and you can conveniently keep it on your desk or nightstand.

 At under $20, it's very affordable, and you can choose from four colors, including [green](https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Wireless-Charging-Station-Designed/dp/B088BB6977?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). But like all wireless chargers, it needs a power brick, which isn't bundled with the charger. You'll have to buy one separately if you don't have a spare. The [Anker Elite Dual Port 24W Wall Charger](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-PowerPort-PowerIQ-Foldable/dp/B071YMZ4LD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a good budget option if you need a power brick for the Wireless Future Charger.

 Unfortunately, as the charger's cradle is the exact size to accommodate just the official AirPods Pro case, there's no space for any protective cover. If you use a cover for the AirPods Pro case and don't want to remove it for charging, [Wireless Future Charger's Pad-Style AirPods Charger](https://www.amazon.com/FutureCharger-Wireless-Charging-Bluetooth-Earphone/dp/B082FVYL7R?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) will be more suitable.

 Earbuds can get pretty gross. After all, they're known to attract all sorts of dirt and gunk, including earwax. It's a good idea to pick up the [Akiki Cleaner Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Compatible-Cleaning-Bluetooth-Cellphones-Earphones/dp/B09M3QT2ZJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204180&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F837615%2Fbest-apple-airpods-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 The kit has everything you need to clean your AirPods, including an effective cleaning putty. This putty can remove all build-up from in and around the speaker grill.

 Even better, you can use this cleaning kit with your other devices, like smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, cameras, and laptops. At $8, the Akiki Cleaner Kit is economical, and it comes with a carrying case for easy portability.

 If you purchase this kit, use the metal pen tip carefully. If used carelessly, it can inflict damage.

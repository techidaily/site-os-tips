 Of course, not all of us have the skills or time to fix broken phone screen. When you decide to repair screen in this way, you must be aware that you may get your broken screen phone to brick. If you can take that risk, move one…

### Method 2\. Get the mobile provider/phone manufacturer to fix cracked phone screen

 If you cracked your phone screen during your manufacturer's warranty period, you should be able to get it fixed for free and within a few hours' time. (Bear in mind, though, that the standard limited warranties of many manufacturers, such as Samsung, do not cover accidents.) Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost upwards of $100.

 Otherwise, a quick Internet search should give you a list of phone screen repair stores around your area. Just make sure your phone is protected by a password before you hand it off to a stranger.

 **Are you OK with paying for the cloud backup service, how much?**

 We have to admit that almost all free cloud backup services are limited in storage space, even including the iCloud, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive and Google Drive. And if you really need to backup something, these offered free storages are not enough. When you want to purchase a cloud backup service, you should compare the prices and then make your decision.

**Do you upload private or sensitive data to the cloud service?**

 When you back up some personal information to external hard drive, you feel safe and don't care too much about the information leaks.

You may know little about the cloud technology and its service, but you just feel not security, right? So when you think about using a cloud backup, you should pay more attention to its data protection.

**Do you need more extra features besides the basic backup?**

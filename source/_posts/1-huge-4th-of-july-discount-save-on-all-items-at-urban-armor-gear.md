## 1. Huge 4Th of July Discount: Save on All Items at Urban Armor Gear

Need a new phone case? Now is your chance to get a great new rugged case from Urban Armor Gear!

 It's summertime, so that means it's time to get outside and enjoy the great outdoors, whether it's the beach, a nice hike, or simply taking the dog for a walk.

 But you need to make sure you're prepared first! Besides the necessities like sunscreen and [a way to keep cool](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09G9KYPVP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003956&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fuag-july-4-sale%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), you need to keep your devices safe from the elements. No one likes enjoying a nice day at the pool and realizing that water got into their phone's charger port, or it took a tumble onto the concrete and has a nasty scratch on it.

 Your best bet is to pick up a rugged caseâ€”one that can withstand your summer adventures and keep your phone intact. [Urban Armor Gear](https://sovrn.co/15dwnpn) (UAG) has long been a fan at How-To Geek, with the company's rugged line (specifically the Civilian series) often making an appearance in our case roundups. For example, the Civilian series case is our pick for the [best rugged case for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-commanders-clash-the-ultimate-ranking-of-7-total-war-games/), and this is far from the only accolade we've given a UAG case.

 For the 4th of July, you can save 20% sitewide at UAG's site by using the code **HTG20** at checkout! If you're not sure what to get, you might want to look into a [Metropolis series case](https://sovrn.co/t06ghe3) for your tablet, the aforementioned [Civilian series cases](https://sovrn.co/4gojrqq) for your phone, or a [rugged power bank](https://sovrn.co/g4w8hgp) meant to withstand the elements.

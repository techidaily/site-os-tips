## Epic Games Brings Fortnite Back to iOS Devices and Debuts on Android Platform

Four years after its removal from Google’s and Apple’s mobile stores, Fortnite is now available to iPhone owners in the European Union (EU), and there's a new place to get it on Android devices.

 The popular battle royale title launched on August 16 on AltStore PAL, a third-party iPhone marketplace available that has been available since April, and the Epic Games Store, which debuted today on iOS in the EU and Android globally. The game arrived in time for Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5, Season 4: Absolute Doom, which launched today as well. To install Fortnite through Epic, you must first install its store by scanning the QR code on [Epic’s website](https://store.epicgames.com/mobile) using your device’s camera and touching the link to land on the official download page.

 You must click through a few scare screens to authorize the Epic Games Store on your device. The convoluted process is due to Apple and Google introducing “intentionally poor-quality install experiences laden by multiple steps, confusing device settings, and scare screens,” in Epic’s own words. The company provided step-by-step video instructions on downloading and installing the Epic Games Store [for iPhone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=%5F6cmu0NuM3g) and [Android owners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C4RxVF-unI).

[Apple and Google booted Fortnite](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-monster-hunter-rise-installation-errors-and-launch-successfully/) in August 2020 after a stealthy update added web payments against official guidelines. The iPhone maker went one step further and revoked Epic’s developer license. But the tide turned to Epic's favor as increasing regulatory pressure in the ensuing years forced Apple to [half-heartidly introduce changes in the EU](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/the-final-cut-editors-toolkit-10-plugin-winners/) to comply with the bloc’s Digital Markets Act, including allowing alternative app stores and sideloading. Fortnite has remained available on Android through an APK download on Epic's website, and [until recently](https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-is-leaving-the-samsung-galaxy-store-epic-tim-sweeney), on the Galaxy Store on Samsung devices.

 “We’re really excited and grateful for the European DMA law,” Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said. Although Fortnite has returned to iOS in Europe, Sweeney warned that “Apple is still blocking all other iOS users outside of Europe from accessing Fortnite and Epic Games Store for iOS.” Epic also announced that Fortnite will be available later via other third-party digital stores, including Aptoide’s iOS store in the EU and the ONE Store on Android.

 Aside from Fortnite, the mobile store carried Rocket League Sideswipe and an all-new Fall Guys mobile game at launch. Epic says all three titles are also available on the AltStore PAL for iPhone in the EU. The Epic Games Store should have a curated selection of titles from third-party developers by December. Epic says developers will be allowed to use their custom billing systems for in-app purchases in apps distributed through its store.

 It all sounds rosy, but good luck convincing iOS developers to distribute their warez through alternative app stores. The key obstacle here is Apple’s controversial Core Technology Fee (€0.50 per year for each install after the first million) imposed on developers who distribute their software outside the App Store. This is exactly why AltStore PAL used to require a monthly subscription to cover this fee. That’s no longer the case as [AltStore PAL is now free for EU users](https://os-tips.techidaily.com/locating-your-itunes-backups-a-step-by-step-guide-to-finding-and-managing-backup-files/), and you can thank financial backing from Epic Games itself for that.

## How to Manage iOS Voice Memos and Ringtones on Windows

Using iTunes to manage your voice memo ringtone comes with a great risk to mess up your iTunes Library if you don't follow the official instruction properly, and that long-winded tale would always ask you to pay more patience to sit through.

[DearMob iPhone Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/iphone-manager/) is a trusted software to help you to backup, transfer and sort out your voice memos and ringtone in simply a few clicks.

## Manage iOS Voice Memos on Windows PC

In DearMob,  
 You are allowed to **batch process** the downloading and deletion of voice memos. 

**1\. For iOS 15 and higher:**

**Step 1\. Create a custom folder to save the voice memo in File-sharing enabled app.**

* To do so, you need to first make sure your device has an iOS or iPadOS app that works with File Sharing. For instance, the Pages, Numbers, and Keynotes apps from Apple support the File Sharing feature.
* Connect your iPhone to DearMob iPhone Manager, and go to the Files module from DearMob main interface. Apps that work with File Sharing will show up here.
* Click on one of those Apps to go inside, and hit the icon to create a New Folder. Taking the Pages app as an example: go inside Files > Pages, create a new folder named as voicememo-save or any other name you prefer.

**Step 2\. Find the Save to Files option on iPhone.**

* Go to the Voice Memo app on iPhone, click the Edit option for multiple selections.
* Select one or multiple voice memo recordings, and hit the Share icon at the bottom left corner.
* Now you shall see the **Save to Files** option, tap on it.
* Then hit the <Back option to go back to the interface where you can select to save "**On My iPhone**".

**Step 3\. Save voice memos to the custom folder created in step 1.**

* Tap the On My iPhone option, and find the File Sharing app folder. In this case, it's the Pages folder. Go inside there, and you will spot the custom folder named voicememo-save.
* Hit the Save option to save the voice memos.

**Step 4\. View and manage voice memos in DearMob iPhone Manager > Files > \[the file sharing app you choose\] > \[custom folder\]**

* In this case, we will go to Files > Pages > voicememo-save and find the voice memos saved from iPhone.
* You can click the Refresh button to load the newly added files.

**Bonus Tips:** Besides go to the Files module from the main interface of DearMob, you can also go to the Apps module from the main UI. Apps that supported the file-sharing feature comes with an folder icon besides their logo.

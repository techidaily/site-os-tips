## Essential Steps: Prepare and Update Before Switching to iPhone 15

As you might already be aware, the [iPhone 15](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-reset-your-infinix-hot-40-pro-lock-screen-password-by-drfone-android/) is now finally reaching the hands of buyers. The long-awaited successor to the iPhone 14 series was announced a few days ago, with pre-orders opening shortly after, and now it's finally arriving at doorsteps and mailboxes everywhere. In preparation of you setting up your iPhone 15, however, you might want to install an update before you actually switch phones.

 A critical update is being rolled out to the iPhone 15 series, fixing an issue that's causing problems for some moving phones. Apple has published a support page detailing the steps to follow for some people who have moved phones and had their new phones seemingly stuck on the Apple logo and bricked. If you already migrated and you're suffering from this issue, you'll need to restore the iPhone using the Finder or iTunes before trying again. For most of you, though, the iPhone 15 will ask for an update to iOS 17.0.2, which will fix this issue. The only thing fixed with the update is this issue, and nothing else — no feature additions or anything of the like.

 The good part is that the update popup will show up before you actually set up the phone, so you don't really have a choice. If you got the phone before the update rolled out, however, or if the update popup didn't show up for whatever reason, you might still be affected by this issue. If that's the case, you should definitely still read through Apple's support page on this issue — having your flaming new phone die before you even set it up, on the very first day after it shipped, is certainly not fun. Chances are that this update is also already pre-installed on new units shipping from now onwards, so if you buy your iPhone now or in the next few days, you probably won't even need to pay attention to this article.

 Make sure to update your new phone now if it already shipped to you. If it's still on its way, then definitely keep an eye out for this.

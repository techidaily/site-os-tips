## Affordable PopSockets iPhone Case with Built-In MagSafe Wallet at a Great Value

Get a slim wallet attachment for your phone—but don't pay Apple's prices for it.

 I like the idea of a slim wallet I can keep with my phone. Wallet cases are bulky, and the flap can often get in the way of the camera. I like traveling light for errands, and in those cases, I don't need more than one or two cards, and something like the [Apple FineWoven Wallet](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-FineWoven-Wallet-MagSafe/dp/B0CHWWMDXR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003331&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fpopsockets-wallet%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) would be the perfect solution.

 But my daily driver is an Android phone, so I can't use [MagSafe accessories](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-achieving-broadcast-excellence-your-guide-to-youtubes-live-360-videos/) unless I place the proper magnets in my phone case. Also, let's face it: The FineWoven Wallet accessory is expensive for what it is. As helpful an accessory as it can be, it's hard to justify $59 for what is essentially a small sleeve.

 Apparently, Popsockets saw a market for something similar and less expensive, and the company created the PopWallet. The [Minimalist Slim PopWallet](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CDPLT13M?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003331&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fpopsockets-wallet%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is very similar to the Apple MagSafe wallet, but you can get it at a fraction of the cost, with a $35 MSRP. Even better, the PopWallet has a MagSafe adapter ring included—place it in your phone case, and you can use this wallet, even if you have an Android phone.

 While the $35 asking price is already a good deal, currently these Minimalist Wallets are half off. All three colorways are on sale at [PopSockets' site](https://www.popsockets.com/en-us/p/wallets/phone-wallet/white-%E2%80%94-popwallet/806920.html?cgid=popwallet), while the white color is half off at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CDPLT13M?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003331&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fpopsockets-wallet%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate).

 Want something even more versatile? There is also a [PopWallet with a PopSocket attached](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CDN1V5G6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003331&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fpopsockets-wallet%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) to the back—so you don't need to detach your wallet to have a solid way to hold and prop up your phone. These PopWallets are not currently on sale, but for $25 it's a good deal even without a discount. There are a ton of color options, too, so everyone can find a match for their style.

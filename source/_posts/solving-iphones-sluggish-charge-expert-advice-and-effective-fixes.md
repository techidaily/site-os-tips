## Part 1\. Why Is My iPhone Volume So Low - 7 Reasons Behind It

 When your iPhone's sound is low, there could be several reasons why it happens. Before you jump to a conclusion or assume that there is a hardware problem, consider these potential causes first.

### 1\. Media Volume Settings

 One of the most common reasons volume is low is accidentally adjusting the media volume slider. When you are playing media, pressing the volume buttons on the side helps you to adjust the volume precisely. Pressing the volume down button can decrease the volume of what is playing on your iPhone.

### 2\. Do Not Disturb Mode

 Why is the iPhone ring volume low? Disturb mode might lower the volume of your notifications, rings, and calls. When this mode is activated, the name suggests it all, and no notification can be heard on your iPhone since you do not want to be disturbed.

![Do Not Disturb](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/solution/iphone-volume-low/do-not-disturb.jpg)

### 3\. Blocked Speakers or Ports

 Dust, lint, water, or other debris can clog your iPhone speakers and ports, reducing the sound output.

 While listening to music or watching movies, you might run into a situation when the audio output can be too low during media playback on your iPhone. The audio remains low even if you have set the volume to the maximum. This media playback error can be fixed with an[audio booster](https://tools.techidaily.com/) app or by re-downloading the media file to get the correct bits that might be missing, causing low audio.

### 6\. Settings Misconfiguration

 Is your iPhone alarm volume low? Settings misconfigurations can cause iPhone volume issues because they alter how the device handles sound output. Specifically, the Change with Buttons option under the Ringer and Alerts section in the Settings app plays a crucial role.

### 7\. Hardware Issues

 There might be a hardware problem with your iPhone speakers that causes low volume. It can be due to playing a media file at maximum volume that leaves strain on the speaker.

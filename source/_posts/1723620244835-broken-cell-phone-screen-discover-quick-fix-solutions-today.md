### Method 2\. Get the mobile provider/phone manufacturer to fix cracked phone screen

 If you cracked your phone screen during your manufacturer's warranty period, you should be able to get it fixed for free and within a few hours' time. (Bear in mind, though, that the standard limited warranties of many manufacturers, such as Samsung, do not cover accidents.) Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost upwards of $100.

 Otherwise, a quick Internet search should give you a list of phone screen repair stores around your area. Just make sure your phone is protected by a password before you hand it off to a stranger.

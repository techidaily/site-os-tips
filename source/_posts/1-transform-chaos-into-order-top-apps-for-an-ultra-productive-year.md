Todoist

 To-do lists are one of the best ways to stay on top of everything you have to do. Not only that, but few things are more satisfying than checking off tasks as you complete them. If you're looking for a great to-do list app, you'll want to check out Todoist for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU905141/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.todoist&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/todoist-to-do-list-planner/id572688855).

## **Best Pomodoro-Inspired Timer: Engross ([Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU905141/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.engross) and [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/engross-focus-timer-to-do/id1494680611))** 

![Screenshots show the interface of the Engross app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4e7a22d8.png) 

Engross

 The Pomodoro Technique has been growing in popularity among people who want to be more productive. The idea is that you work in focused, 25-minute intervals and then take a quick break. If you'd like to try this technique for yourself, many apps can help. However, we're big fans of Engross for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU905141/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.engross) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/engross-focus-timer-to-do/id1494680611).

 Engross includes a Pomodoro-inspired timer that you can customize as well as a stopwatch to help with your time management needs. These aren't the only features of this app, though. You can maintain a daily routine by using the planner and calendar features and review statistics to track your work time and growth. We also find that the app block/app whitelist function is a great way to block out distractions during a work session.

## **A Fun Approach to Staying Focused: Forest ([Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU905141/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.forestapp) and [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/forest-focus-for-productivity/id866450515))**

Forest

 Staying focused can be a challenge, especially when there are so many interesting websites and apps to explore. If you find yourself having trouble staying on task, you might want to try an app to help. For a fun option, we recommend Forest for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU905141/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.forestapp) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/forest-focus-for-productivity/id866450515).

 The way the app works is simple. You'll plant a virtual tree when you want to stay focused on a task. As you work, your tree grows and thrives. However, if you leave the app before your task is finished, your tree will die. Over time, you can grow an entire virtual forest to see the fruits of your focus and labor. Best of all, Forest partners with Trees for the Future, a real-life organization that plants trees, and you can spend virtual coins to plant these real trees.

Productive Habit Tracker

 Building a new habit can take anywhere from 18 days to nearly a year, depending on the person and the behavior. If you want to incorporate a new habit into your life, it can be hard to keep at it without a little help. Thankfully, the Productive app is available for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU905141/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apalon.to.do.list) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/productive-habit-tracker/id983826477).

 This free and helpful habit tracker app can help you set goals and turn them into life-changing habits. We love that this app works both ways, as you can use it to start a new good habit or break an old bad one. You can view statistics to see how well you're doing with your new habit and plan your day, and set reminders to keep you on track. The Productive app also features fun challenges to help you with habit formation.

## **Best for Staying On Top of Chores: Sweepy ([Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU905141/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.sweepy.sweepy) and [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sweepy-home-cleaning-schedule/id1498897320))**

## **Best for Keeping Track of Family Member Schedules: FamilyWall ([Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU905141/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.familywall) and [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/familywall-family-organizer/id496889629))** 

![Screenshots show the interface of the FamilyWall app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/66185de4.png) 

FamilyWall

 When you have a family, it can be a challenge to keep track of each person's schedule. If you're worried about missing a doctor's appointment or a soccer game, an app can help you. We've found the FamilyWall app for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU905141/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.familywall) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/familywall-family-organizer/id496889629) helps keep it all straight.

 Many people love using FamilyWall for its shared calendar feature that syncs with Google Calendar and Outlook Calendar. However, that's not all this app offers. It also includes shared to-do lists, a finance tracker, a grocery list, a meal planner, and even a [family member locator](https://www.reviewgeek.com/2241/use-these-7-great-apps-to-share-your-location-with-friends-and-family/). Additionally, you'll find a photo and video album and a secure messaging system to keep in touch with the whole family.

![Screenshots show the interface of the Headspace app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/64f0b5b9.png)

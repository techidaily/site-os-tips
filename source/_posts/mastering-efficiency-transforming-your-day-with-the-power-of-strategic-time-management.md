 The first memory I have of the concept of time is a watch faceâ€”plain white background with black numbers around the edge. Maybe this influenced my choice of a time management daily planner, but Sectograph hits all the right spots and has convinced me that time really is a flat circle.

##  What Is Sectograph?![Sectograph Widget](https://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sectograph-widget.jpg) 

[Sectograph](https://sectograph.com/) is the app that changed how I see the day and plan my schedule. Available for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003682/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=prox.lab.calclock&hl=en%5FUS) and [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sectograph-visual-time-manager/id1528168188), this time management app has given me a different perspective on how I spend my time. As someone who relies on [tips for working from home](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-prime-list-of-screenshot-tools-for-mac-os/), this app was one of the best. The most important thing is how it syncs with my existing Google Calendar, so I never have to worry about what's happening and when it's happening.

 The Sectograph widget is a flat circle, like a clock. It has hands on it to show the time, but it also divides the day up into different slices. Because it takes data from Google Calendar, you can even set up the sectors to have different colors depending on the type of activity you have planned for that sector.

 One of the things that impressed me most about this app was how it gave me a heads-up about what was coming a few hours from now. It can warn you of something you might have missed if it's set up right. I must thank Sectograph for helping me catch a few client meetings I would have missed otherwise.

##  Why Sectograph Works for Me

 Before Sectograph, I really didn't care about [time management apps](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fix-pokemon-go-route-not-working-on-nokia-g22-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). As a professional, I typically have a lot of things to do but not enough time to do them. Scheduling my day gives me some sense of structure. I divided my day into "Work Segments" and "Rest Segments," allowing for a decent work-life balance. However, sometimes I ignore Sectograph because something else takes priority, like a meeting or a discussion with a client.

 Sectograph is a good fit for me because I am a very visual person. When other people were memorizing formulae in math class, I was trying to figure out how I could put things into a graph. Seeing Sectograph giving me that pie-chart vibe is perfect for my graphical mind.

 Establishing a routine is crucial. Outside of work hours, structuring your life around an app might feel overbearing, but the truth is, you're likely to get more done. The [block scheduling system has proven benefits](https://www.wired.com/story/block-scheduling-calendar-workflow-productivity/), and it's still being used in schools today. I combine the block scheduling system with [the Pomodoro system](https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/how-to-get-the-latest-geforce-gtx-460-graphics-card-drivers-installed-on-your-pc/) to increase my productivity while paying attention to my needs.

##  How You Can Use Sectograph In Your Daily Life

 So how would a regular person integrate Sectograph into their everyday life? Once you know [how to create and customize a new Google Calendar entry](https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/fallout-4-troubleshooting-how-to-resolve-the-black-display-problem/), you're on your way. Here are some of the things I've found that work well with it:

* **Daily scheduling and visual timing:** Sectograph's visual representation of your day makes it easy to see what's coming up at a glance. You can quickly [plan your day in Google Calendar](https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-after-switching-from-xiaomi-redmi-note-13-pro-5g-to-latest-samsung-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/) and copy those day entries across to other relevant days.
* **Accounting and control of working hours:** If you need to track your working hours for billing or productivity purposes, Sectograph can help. Create sectors for your work tasks and let the app track your time on each one.
* **Class schedules and lecture tracking:** Students can benefit from Sectograph by inputting their class schedules and setting reminders for upcoming lectures or exams. The visual layout helps them stay on top of their academic commitments.
* **Self-organization at home:** Use Sectograph to plan your household chores, family activities, and personal hobbies. The app's intuitive interface makes it simple to organize your daily life and ensure you have time for the things that matter most.
* **Travel and flight duration tracking:** When planning a trip, input your flight times and durations into Sectograph. You can easily [add your flight and hotel reservation details to Google Calendar](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/forgotten-the-voicemail-password-of-honor-x50i-try-these-fixes-by-drfone-android/) and have the app display it on the clock face.
* **Meal schedules, medication reminders, and exercise therapy:** Sectograph can serve as a reminder for essential daily tasks like taking medication, preparing meals, or engaging in physical therapy exercises. Set up dedicated sectors for these activities to stay on track with your health goals.
* **Countdown for lengthy scheduled events:** If you have a long-awaited event coming up, such as a wedding or vacation, use Sectograph to create a countdown. The app's visual countdown feature will help you stay excited and prepared for the big day.
* **Time management using GTD (Getting Things Done) technology:** Integrate Sectograph with your [GTD workflow](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) by creating sectors for your subsequent actions, projects, and waiting-for lists. The app's visual format will help you stay organized and focused on your priorities.
* **Goal tracking and achievement:** Use Sectograph to break your long-term goals into daily tasks and habits. By dedicating sectors to your goal-related activities, you can track your progress and stay motivated to achieve your objectives.

 Aside from all this, Sectograph is perfect for seeing what you've got scheduled coming up without breaking out your calendar app.

 What makes Sectograph stand out compared to other time management daily planners? Probably the most significant thing is its widget (available for iPhone and Android). The clock-face widget is one of the most noticeable things on your phone. I typically have mine occupying the central spot of the home screen, expanded to twice the size so I can see everything.

 It's also fully compatible with Wear OS smartwatches, allowing for notifications to be sent directly to you. Most recently, the developers have added support for Microsoft Outlook's calendar, but the feature hasn't been finalized yet. The latest beta release showed off this new addition for users to test.

##  How Sectograph Changed My Time Management

 I've never been good at time management, and when I became self-employed, it became a huge deal. Sectograph helped me sort my day out into usable chunks and then stick to a plan for that particular day. It's such a useful tool that I've also used it to schedule my leisure time.

 What's more, with the app tracking my work time, I know exactly how much time I spend working so I can bill clients properly. Combining it with the Pomodoro method (but not using [the Windows 11 timer](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-mov-files-saving-methods-for-windows-10-users-for-2024/) for it) made for a super helpful addition to my time management arsenal. With all the side projects I have going on, it's a necessary part of managing my life.

 If you're a user who has difficulty managing your time or find yourself missing meetings or invitations from friends because of conflicts, this app is well worth an install. There's a free version that does all the basic stuff you need, so there's no need to pay for the app if all you want is basic functionality. The paid version is a one-time purchase and offers more flexibility for professionals.

 There's a clichÃ© saying, "Time is Money," but that doesn't apply to everyone. Sometimes, time is just something you need for yourself or to balance your work life with your relaxation. Sectograph helped me see how to manage my time best, and I think it could be a massive advantage to anyone who has a hard time managing their time. It doesn't even need to be used to increase your productivity. It could just be something to block out some time for yourself. In any event, it's well worth giving it a try.

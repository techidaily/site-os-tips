 When you are done and want to stop the recording, tap the large red button at the bottom of Voice Memos.

##  Rename a Voice Recording on iPhone

 You might want to name your recordings so they are easily recognizable.

 To do so, in Voice Memos, tap the recording you want to rename, then tap the current recording name to make it editable. Then type a new name for the recording and press Enter.

![Tap the title to change the name of the recording.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tap-the-title.png) 

 Your recording now uses your newly specified name.

##  Share a Voice Recording on iPhone

 You can share your Voice Memos recordings using the [iPhone's standard share menu](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/overview-of-the-best-motorola-moto-e13-screen-mirroring-app-drfone-by-drfone-android/). This means you can share your recordings with [the Files app](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/life360-circle-everything-you-need-to-know-on-nokia-105-classic-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), Google Drive, and even send them via email to someone.

 To access the share menu, open Voice Memos and tap the recording to share. Tap the three-dot menu icon in the upper-right corner to display the "Share" option.

 From the menu that appears, select "Share."

![Tap the "Share" button.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tap-the-share-button.png)

##  Delete a Voice Recording on iPhone

 If you no longer need a voice recording, you can delete individual or multiple recordings at once in Voice Memos.

 To do so, open your recordings, select the recording you'd like to delete, and then tap the trash can icon. 

![Tap the trash can icon.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tap-the-delete-button.png) 

 Voice Memos will move your selected recordings to the "Recently Deleted" folder. The recordings will stay here for 30 days after which they will be [permanently removed](https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/n-2024-youtubes-virality-secrets-effective-hashtag-strategies/).

![Notification that the recording has been moved to recently deleted.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/recording-moved-to-recently-deleted.png) 

 If you'd like to get rid of your recordings permanently without them staying for another 30 days, then tap the "Recently Deleted" folder on Voice Memos' main screen.

![Tap "Recently Deleted."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/recently-deleted.png) 

 At the bottom-right corner of the "Recently Deleted" screen, tap "Delete."

 If you'd like to restore your deleted audio recordings, then tap the "Recover" option instead.

![Tap the "Delete" button in the bottom right corner.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tap-the-delete-button-again.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Make sure you definitely want to remove the recording, then select "Delete Forever" in the menu that opens at the bottom of the screen. 

 You cannot restore your recordings once they are permanently deleted. Make sure you really want to delete them before tapping "Delete Forever"

![Tap "Delete Forever" when you're sure you want an audio file gone for good.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/delete-forever.png)

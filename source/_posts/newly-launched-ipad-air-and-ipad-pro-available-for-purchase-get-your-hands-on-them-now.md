## Newly Launched iPad Air and iPad Pro Available for Purchase - Get Your Hands On Them Now!

Apple announced the new iPad Air and iPad Pro last week, with newer chipsets, Apple Pencil Pro support, and upgraded screens on the Pro models. Now the tablets are finally available to purchase.

 Apple has finally made the redesigned [iPad Air](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/optimizing-fallout-4-performance-for-lightning-fast-loads/) and the new [iPad Pro](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-transform-your-note-habits-with-mematics-tools/) available for purchase, both with upgraded internal hardware and design tweaks. The iPad Air, now available in 11-inch and 13-inch models, boasts the M2 chip with a promise of enhanced performance, a landscape front camera, and faster Wi-Fi. The iPad Pro, which Apple boasts as being the thinnest Apple device ever, introduces a groundbreaking Ultra Retina XDR display and the next-generation M4 chip, the first Apple device to debut it. Both models are equipped for artificial intelligence tasks, leveraging their advanced CPUs, GPUs, and Neural Engines.

 There's a reason why Apple is calling this the biggest iPad upgrade ever. For starters, the M4 chip hasn't even made it to Mac computers, and only a few of them have been updated to use [M3 chips](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-obs-clash-livestream-prodigies-for-2024/). To complement these new iPads, Apple also released a range of accessories. Both models support the Apple Pencil Pro, which offers features like barrel roll, haptic feedback, and squeeze, and the newly designed Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro. Additionally, the Smart Folio cases are available in colors that match the iPad finishes.

 You can [buy the iPad Air](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-air) starting at $599 for the 11-inch model, while the 13-inch model begins at $799\. You can [get the iPad Pro](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro) with an 11-inch screen for $999, and the 13-inch model starts at $1,299\. Both iPad Air and iPad Pro come in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, starlight, space gray, silver, and space black. Both are now available through the Apple Store as well as through retailers, so make sure to grab yours now if you're interested in these new tablets.

 If you're upgrading from an older iPad, and you have an Apple Pencil, keep in mind that you might need to get a different pencil for the newer iPads. The specs pages ([Air](https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/specs/), [Pro](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/specs/)) confirm that only the USB-C Apple Pencil and latest Apple Pencil Pro are compatible, not the second-generation Apple Pencil.

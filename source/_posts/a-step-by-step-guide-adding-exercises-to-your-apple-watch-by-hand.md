### Key Takeaways

 To manually add Apple Watch workouts, launch the Health app, tap on Browse, then select Activity > Workouts. Use the "Add Data" button in the top-right corner to manually log workout type, energy burned, distance, and time.

 Did you fail to log a workout with your [Apple Watch](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-capture-with-clarity-advanced-tips-for-gopro-hero5-black/)? Maybe your wearable ran out of battery while exercising and didn't log your activity correctly. Luckily, you can manually add workouts to your Health app to make up for it.

##  How to Manually Add a Workout to Apple Watch

 Manually log a workout by launching the Health app on your iPhone, then navigating to the "Browse" tab and tapping the "Activity" category. On the screen that appears, tap on "Workouts" to bring up a graph of your logged workouts.

 In the top-right corner of the screen, tap "Add Data" to bring up a data entry form. Use this form to select an "Activity Type" like running or cycling, the amount of energy burned (in kilocalories or kilojoules, depending on your settings) and the distance covered (where applicable).

![Manually enter workout data in Apple Health](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/add_workout.jpg) 

 You can refer to your past activity data to determine how much energy you burned in your chosen workout. For example, if you usually burn around 280 calories on a 2.5-mile hike, you should record twice that amount for a 5-mile walk. You can also use an energy expenditure calculator like [this one](https://www.calculator.net/calories-burned-calculator.html).

 Amend the time and date when the activity took place, then hit "Add" to finalize. The workout will be added to your record and visible in the Health app under Browse > Activity > Workouts and within the Fitness app under Summary > Workouts.

![Workout added via Health as seen in Apple Fitness](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/manual_hiking_workout.jpg) 

 Activity data that you record in this manner will [count towards your Move goal](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-quick-start-method-for-combining-obs-and-zoom/) and help you close your activity rings. Activities that have been added manually will display the Health app icon rather than the usual Apple Watch Workout icons.

##  How to Remove Workout Data From Apple Watch

 If you want to delete a workout that you have recorded, either manually or using your Apple Watch, you can do so easily using either the Health or Fitness apps on your iPhone.

 You'll get the choice of deleting a workout entry or deleting the data too. If you delete the data, your daily activity total will be affected (and so will your Move ring).

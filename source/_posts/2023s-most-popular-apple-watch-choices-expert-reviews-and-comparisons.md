##  What to Look For in an Apple Watch in 2023

 The Apple Watch is much more than a timepiece with a screen instead of dials. When the smartwatch first debuted, it might have been just a novel gadget that could show the time and buzz you with notifications, but the Apple Watch has come a long way since then. These days, the Apple Watch is a fitness tracking device, a GPS beacon, and a way to ensure you never miss out on an important message. It's also a flexible fashion accessory.

 All models of the Apple Watch are [waterproof](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-superior-mac-screen-recorder-options-not-bandicam/), so you can even wear them while swimming. The latest models like the Series 9 even include features like an FDA-approved [ECG monitor](https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/discovering-the-joy-of-low-cost-drone-flight-with-symas-s111g-model/) and a [blood oxygen sensor](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/seamlessly-integrate-pip-on-microsoft-edge-for-2024/) to monitor your vitals. The Apple Watch is simply hard to beat in smartwatch technology.

 Earlier Apple Watch models played it fairly safe with finish and color options, but now you can get the newest Apple Watch in various finishes and colors. You can accessorize with a variety of [Apple Watch bands](https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-huawei-nova-y71-location-on-twitter-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), as well.

 Now that you know what you're looking at, let's get into the best Apple Watches you can buy today.

##  Best Apple Watch Overall: [Apple Watch Series 9](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch)

| Pros                       | Cons                                          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Apple S9 processor       | ✗ Find iPhone feature is limited to iPhone 15 |
| ✓ Siri access on-device    | ✗ No real design improvements                 |
| ✓ Bright and vivid display |                                               |
| ✓ Double-tap gesture       |                                               |

 While the [Apple Watch Series 9](http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch) is not Apple's flagship smartwatch in 2023, it does most of the boxes for most users. Despite the [Apple Watch Ultra 2](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-ultra) taking the crown as the ultimate Apple Watch, you will need to fork out at least an additional $400 for the pleasure, making it a hard recommendation for many.

 The Series 9 might look similar to the [Series 8](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Always/dp/B0BDHM49BJ?tag=htg-v2-1ufuth1-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208338&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761017%2Fbest-apple-watch%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), but under the hood, a few things have changed. One thing that hasn't, however, is the starting price of $399 for the GPS-only model. But, as you feast your eyes on the Series 9, you'll be pleasantly surprised by a few things, such as the display's max brightness of [2000 nits](https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-build-stellar-youtube-beginnings-on-a-shoestring-budget/), outdoing the Series 8 already.

 With a [new S9 processor](https://driver-download.techidaily.com/latest-amd-rx-6800-driver-download-for-windows-users-windows-111087/) and U2 ultrawide-band chip, the Apple Watch Series 9 allows you to double-tap your index finger and thumb to answer calls, launch widgets, and so on. Pretty nifty!

 No further improvements have been made to the Series 8's temperature sensor and [fall/crash detection](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-is-my-friends-account-invisible-potential-block/). Similarly, battery life lasts up to 18 hours, or 36 hours in low power mode.

 There's not much to shout about in terms of the differences between the Apple Watch Series 8 and Series 9, however, if you don't already have an Apple Watch and are considering purchasing one, the Series 9 is the way to go.

 Encompassing all the watch's favorite features from the previous series, the Apple Watch Series 9 boasts an awesome new double-tap feature, brilliantly bright and vivid always-on display, and offline Siri access.

| Pros                                                    | Cons                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| ✓ Affordable and cheaper than the original Watch SE     | ✗ No always-on display  |
| ✓ Includes the same S8 chip as Series 8 and Watch Ultra | ✗ Lacks dust resistance |
| |  ✗ No ECG or Blood Oxygen apps                        |                         |

 The [Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDJ1MVBV?tag=htg-v2-1ufuth1-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208338&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761017%2Fbest-apple-watch%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is not only an upgrade over its previous generation but also replaces the Series 3 as the cheapest smartwatch in the company's portfolio, making it a no-brainer if you want an affordable Apple Watch. But that doesn't mean the new Watch SE is a slacker.

 The 2022 model packs the same S8 chip as the more expensive Series 8 and Watch Ultra, so you get the same snappy performance. The new chip also makes the smartwatch futureproof, so you won't need to upgrade for at least a few years unless you want to.

 Still available in [40mm](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHTQDRZ?tag=htg-v2-1ufuth1-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208338&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761017%2Fbest-apple-watch%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [44mm](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHQT11V?tag=htg-v2-1ufuth1-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208338&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761017%2Fbest-apple-watch%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) versions, the Watch SE (2nd Gen) looks the same as its predecessor, but Apple has redesigned the back to color-match the aluminum case. Plus, the smartwatch includes new accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to offer the Crash Detection feature like the other new Apple Watch models.

 The smartwatch is also great for essential health and fitness tracking. You get all-day activity tracking, sleep tracking, and heart-rate monitoring. The watchOS 9 handles the software duties and brings almost all the newly introduced bells and whistles, including updated [Workout](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/workout/id1584215851) and [Compass](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/compass/id1067456176) apps, more insights into your sleep, and a new [Medications](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/medications/id1621166653) experience.

 Unfortunately, while the Watch SE (2nd Gen) offers a lot of what's available in the Series 8, it lacks an always-on display, ECG app, ability to monitor blood oxygen saturation, dust resistance, and temperature sensors, among the significant features.

 However, if these features are not a deal-breaker for you, it's an excellent option for an iPhone owner looking for their first smartwatch or a budget pick. Moreover, the Watch SE (2nd Gen) launch price is $30 less than its predecessor, making it a better value for money and an enticing purchase.

Best Budget Apple Watch

#####  Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen, 40mm)

From the same chip as the Series 8 to the lower price than its predecessor, the newest Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) has a lot going for it.

| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| ✓ GPS and cellular options are affordable | ✗ Lack of always-on display |
| ✓ Lightweight and comfortable to wear     | ✗ No built-in ECG           |
| ✓ Decent battery life                     |                             |

 The [Apple Watch SE](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDJ1MVBV?tag=htg-v2-1ufuth1-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208338&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761017%2Fbest-apple-watch%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) comes in two variations; [GPS](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Smart-Midnight-Aluminum/dp/B0BDJ1MVBV?tag=htg-v2-1ufuth1-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208338&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761017%2Fbest-apple-watch%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [cellular](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cellular-Smartwatch-Aluminum-Detection/dp/B0CHX97GXJ?tag=htg-v2-1ufuth1-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208338&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761017%2Fbest-apple-watch%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). The GPS version allows you to make calls and send messages as long as your iPhone is nearby. However, if you want to go out and be able to use certain features [without your iPhone](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-the-definitive-playbook-enhancing-your-videos-first-impression/), you'll need to upgrade to the cellular version. This costs an additional $50 but is worth the added investment.

 If you're searching for an affordable Apple Watch, regardless of which version you choose, the SE is a solid choice. Granted, it omits a few cool features like the built-in ECG app, double tap gesture, and always-on display, but it does boast crash detection, Family Setup, and up to 18 hours of battery life on normal use.

 Apple Watch models with a cellular connection support the [Family Setup feature](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211768). With this feature, you can set up the Apple Watch for a family member who doesn't own an iPhone. It's particularly helpful if you don't want to give your child an iPhone but want them to stay connected.

 If you're a fitness enthusiast who wants to track metrics without lugging the bulk of an iPhone with you, the Apple Watch SE ensures you can make phone calls, stream music from Apple Music, and receive notifications without your iPhone.

 Yes, there are more powerful Apple Watch models available with cellular, but if the functionality of cellular is what you need without all the added features, the Apple Watch SE is a budget-friendly option that is pretty snappy and will last you all day.

Best Apple Watch with Cellular Service

| Pros                            | Cons                    |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| ✓ Titanium build                | ✗ Expensive             |
| ✓ Apple S9 processor            | ✗ Quite large and bulky |
| ✓ Brightest Apple Watch display |                         |
| ✓ Built-in cellular             |                         |

 Outdoor adventurers must have a reliable and durable watch if it's going to stand the test of time. The [Apple Watch Ultra 2](http://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cellular-Smartwatch-Precision-Extra-Long/dp/B0CHX8Z6W4?tag=htg-v2-1ufuth1-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208338&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761017%2Fbest-apple-watch%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) boasts 100m water resistance, is swimproof, can be taken on a recreational dive up to 40m, and can withstand high-speed water sports. Not to mention, it's made from titanium, so is the most durable Apple Watch you can get your hands on.

 Apple claims the Ultra 2 has been tested against the [MIL-STD-810H standard](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/are-opinions-on-goods-compensated-in-videos-for-2024/). The sapphire crystal is protected from edge impacts thanks to the rugged and corrosion-resistant case. With an IP6X dust-resistant rating, this Apple Watch is able to take a beating.

 But underneath the hard exterior, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 features the biggest and brightest Apple Watch display yet. The always-on display at [3000 nits](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/social-sharing-simplified-uploading-immersive-mobile-photography/) makes it the perfect companion for outdoor activities since the screen is easier to read in the sunlight. You can also customize the display to your heart's content, making sure you have everything you need at your fingertips.

 Supporting Apple's double-tap gesture feature, you can easily interact with your smartwatch by double-tapping your index finger and thumb. This means you can answer calls, send messages, and pause timers. Things you might not want to stop for should you be out and about.

 Feature a dual-frequency GPS system, you'll be able to accurately track your fitness metrics across a range of environments. Plus, there's access to plenty of new fitness features and compatibility with third-party accessories.

 For the ultimate Apple Watch experience, look no further than the Apple Watch Ultra 2.

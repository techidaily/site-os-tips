 The easiest way to [print text messages from an iPhone](https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/how-to-stop-microsoft-edge-from-crashing-on-windows-11-proven-fixes/) is to print screenshots of the conversation. Apple's default "Photos" app conveniently has a "Print" option in the share menu. All you need is a Wi-Fi-connected printer.

 First, [take a screenshot on your iPhone](https://location-social.techidaily.com/simple-and-effective-ways-to-change-your-country-on-youtube-app-of-your-samsung-galaxy-a14-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) of the text conversation from the Messages app. Do this by pressing and holding the Power + Volume Up keys, or Power + Home button.

##  How to Print Text Messages From Android

 The most straightforward method for [printing text messages on Android](https://win-dash.techidaily.com/solution-guide-restoring-access-to-disabled-dts-audio-features-on-targeted-audio-devices/) is taking screenshots of the conversation. You can put those screenshots on a blank document and print to a Wi-Fi-connected printer.

 First, open the text conversation and scroll to the part you'd like to print. To [take screenshots on an Android device](https://location-social.techidaily.com/3-things-you-must-know-about-fake-snapchat-location-on-samsung-galaxy-f15-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), press and hold both the Power + Volume Down buttons for a second.

 After you've taken the screenshots, add them screenshots to a blank document in [Google Docs](https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=e7eab128eb8d1c53e14db14f4c632447&u=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.google.android.apps.docs.editors.docs&cuid=xid:fr1678474641aaa) or [Microsoft Word](https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=e7eab128eb8d1c53e14db14f4c632447&u=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.microsoft.office.word&cuid=xid:fr1678474641aab).

 When you have the screenshots laid out, look for a share button in whichever app you choose to use. It may be in a menu accessed by a [hamburger icon](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/recover-your-contacts-after-oppo-reno-8t-has-been-deleted-by-fonelab-android-recover-contacts/) or three dots. Select "Print" from the sharing menu.

 You'll see the built-in Android printing dialog. You can print to a Wi-Fi-connected printer, or choose "Save as PDF" and transfer the [PDF](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-obs-vs-wirecast-which-should-you-trust-for-live/) to a computer connected to a printer. Tap the printer icon or "PDF" button when you're ready.

![Tap print or &quot;PDF.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-03-06_15-59-46.png?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1) 

 For a cleaner result, you can try using an app called "[SMS Backup & Restore](https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=e7eab128eb8d1c53e14db14f4c632447&u=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore&cuid=xid:fr1678474641aac)."

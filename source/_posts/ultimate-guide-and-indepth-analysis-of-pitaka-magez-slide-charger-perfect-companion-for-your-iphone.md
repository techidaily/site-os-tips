### Key Takeaways

* The PITAKA MagEZ Slider 2 is a space-saving charging station that offers wireless charging for multiple devices, including iPhones, AirPods, and Apple Watch.
* The design includes useful features like a removable wireless power bank, LED indicators, a rotating dock, and a magnetized mini-shelf for AirPods.

 The [PITAKA MagEZ Slider 2](https://www.amazon.com/PITAKA-MagSafe-Charger-iPhone-Portable/dp/B09NPZ981N?tag=htg-v2-35jb8lu-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228049&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fpitaka-magez-slider-2-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is an ergonomic desktop charging station that delivers a decent supply of wireless power to your iPhone, AirPods, Apple Watch, and a few non-Apple devices, too. And while it's a solid peripheral, there are a few problem areas that could do with some addressing.

* **Weight:** 0.52lbs (238g)

 No larger than your typical coffee mug, the [PITAKA MagEZ Slider 2](https://www.ipitaka.com/products/magez-slider?variant=40329067921478) may look small, but literally every part of this charging station has some kind of power feature to take advantage of. Looking at it from the front, you'll see an indentation for the removable wireless power bank. When docked, the bottom of the bank connects to the USB-C input on the Slider 2\. As long as the Slider 2 is connected to a wall outlet, the docking bay will deliver constant power to the charger.

 Conveniently, there's also an LED indicator on both the front of the bank to let you know how much power is left, with a second status light located next to the dock's rear-facing USB-C input, to let you know that the entire station is receiving power.

 On the left side of the Slider 2, you'll see a little up-down toggle switch. When in the up position, you'll be able to rotate the entire docking station 360 degrees, and it makes the most pleasant sound in the world when spinning (like a playing card stuffed into the spokes of a bicycle tire). To prevent the Slider 2 from rotating, simply put the switch into the down position to lock the dock in place.

 On the right side of the Slider 2, you'll see a side-mounted USB-C output. This connection is meant for the Apple Watch's MFi-certified power dongle, allowing you to dock and charge your Apple Watch while the Slider 2 is topping off your iPhone and/or AirPods. Do note that you'll need to purchase the [MagEZ Slider 2 + Power Dongle bundle](https://www.ipitaka.com/products/magez-slider?currency=USD&variant=40329068052550&utm%5Fmedium=cpc&utm%5Fsource=google&utm%5Fcampaign=Google%20Shopping&utm%5Fsource=google&utm%5Fmedium=cpc&utm%5Fcampaign=Pmax+-+US+-+Slider2&ref=google%5Fads&utm%5Fid=18873172015&utm%5Fsource=google&utm%5Fmedium=cpc&utm%5Fcontent=Pmax-x&utm%5Fterm=shopify%5FUS%5F7010412822598%5F40329068052550&utm%5Fcampaign=Pmax+-+US+-+Slider2) in order to get the Watch accessory.

 Speaking of AirPods: Did you notice the little black gadget in the Slider 2 box? This is actually a magnetized mini-shelf designed for an earbuds case that mounts to the back of the Slider 2\. When seated, your AirPods will receive up to 5 watts of Qi-wireless charging (as long as the Slider 2 is plugged in). Flipping the device over, you'll see the Slider 2's puck-shaped pedestal, with a protective film placed over the center. This is to protect the reusable gel pad hiding underneath, a godsend when placing the Slider 2 on a desk or table.

 All in all, we've got a pretty solid design on our hands, but do you know what's missing? A power adapter. Yes, the Slider 2 comes with a USB-C cable, but you'll need to [supply the actual AC outlet brick yourself](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/freedom-in-viewing-is-vlc-more-powerful-than-mpc-for-2024/).

* **Type:** 4,000mAh (rechargeable)
* **Power Bank Output:** Up to 7.5W
* **Docking Station Output:** Up to 5W

 The biggest selling point of the PITAKA MagEZ Slider 2 is that it delivers Qi wireless charging for several devices at the same time. Unfortunately, we're not talking about any kind of PD-certified charging, considering there's not a single part of the Slider 2 that plugs directly into a phone, earbud case, or watch (unless you use your own USB-C to Lightning cable). That being said, the best you're going to get from the removable wireless power bank is around 7.5 watts, and you'll only get up to 5 watts for charging your earbuds and wearables from the actual charging station. Is this a big deal? Not necessarily, but I think it's a good idea to go into the Slider 2 with the expectation that it's going to deliver a slower recharging experience overall.

 When the wireless power bank is docked, you'll be able to mount certain iPhones and Galaxy smartphones to the front of the power bank for portrait and landscape views. The magnetization actually works really well, and while I don't have a MagSafe case for my iPhone 12, I'm willing to bet that most [MagSafe-certified cases](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-achieving-broadcast-excellence-your-guide-to-youtubes-live-360-videos/) will work just fine with the Slider 2.

 One thing I was a big fan of was that little AirPods mini-shelf. Once magnetized to the back of the Slider 2, the shelf didn't move an inch when I placed my AirPods case on top of it, and it had no trouble charging the earbuds.

 Personally, I think I would pass on the [PITAKA MagEZ Slider 2](https://www.amazon.com/PITAKA-MagSafe-Charger-iPhone-Portable/dp/B09NPZ981N?tag=htg-v2-35jb8lu-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228049&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fpitaka-magez-slider-2-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate). It's not a bad charging station by any means, but it just doesn't do enough, in my opinion. If the charging station was MagSafe certified and could deliver up to at least 15 watts (heck, even 10 watts), I might be thinking differently. But considering you don't even get a USB-C power brick, I think I'd look elsewhere (unless there was really good sale).

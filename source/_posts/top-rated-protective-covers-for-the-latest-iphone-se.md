##  What to Look For in an iPhone SE Case in 2024

 Finding a protective iPhone SE case is surprisingly challenging. Not only do you need to make sure you're shopping for the correct SE model, but you'll need to wade through hundreds of products from dozens of manufacturers---some of which aren't built to withstand significant impact.

 If you know where you're looking, however, there are plenty of great options. The easiest way to find a good iPhone SE case is to stick with long-standing manufacturers such as ZAGG, Spigen, and OtterBox. These companies have been producing high-quality cases for years, and you can be certain that their lineup of iPhone SE cases is built to the same standards.

 You'll also want to consider how much protection you need for your new iPhone. If you're prone to dropping your phone or standing up with it on your lap, you'd be best served with something that covers all ports and buttons. If you need it to fit in a pocket for ease of use, opting for a slim fit or clear case is a better choice. Be sure to think carefully about how (and where) you plan on using your iPhone before springing for a case.

 Once you've figured out your basic needs, we've put together a list of the best iPhone SE cases below. Whether you're looking for a case that doubles as a wallet, something with a bit of flair, or a case that encloses your phone like a fortress, here are a few great products to consider.

| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| ✓ Built by Apple                             | ✗ Not meant for rugged use |

 Nobody knows the iPhone SE better than Apple, so it should come as no surprise that the tech giant makes one of the best cases on the market. Offered in four colors ([Chalk Pink](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MN6G3ZM/A/iphone-se-silicone-case-chalk-pink), [Abyss Blue](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MN6F3ZM/A/iphone-se-silicone-case-abyss-blue?), [Midnight](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MN6E3ZM/A/iphone-se-silicone-case-midnight), and [Product Red](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MN6H3ZM/A/iphone-se-silicone-case-productred)), the [Silicone Case](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MN6G3ZM/A/iphone-se-silicone-case-chalk-pink) perfectly contours your iPhone SE, providing a slim profile while still protecting your new device from drops and scratches.

 Unlike most products in the Apple catalog, the Silicone Case is actually rather affordable, clocking in at just $35\. However, despite its low price tag, no corners were cut in its production.

 Built from a soft-touch silicone that's compatible with wireless charging, the case covers most edges of the iPhone SE, with a small cutout on the side for Ring/Silent toggle and a larger cutout on the bottom for its various ports and speakers.

 Because of its slim profile and various cutouts, Apple's Silicone Case isn't meant for rugged use. So if you're planning on some wild excursions or have some precarious hobbies, you might want to consider [something with a bit more support](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-check-if-your-infinix-hot-30i-is-unlocked-by-drfone-android/).

 Everyone else, however, will find an affordable, well-designed product that is more than capable of keeping your phone safe during daily use.

| ✓ Compatible with wireless charging |                   |

 Clocking in at well under $20, you'd be hard-pressed to find an iPhone SE case as affordable and versatile as the [Spigen Tough Armor](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Tough-Armor-Designed-iPhone/dp/B083KQ7MY7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F791313%2Fbest-iphone-se-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Built with interior impact foam, flexible TPU material, and a hard outer shell, this rugged case provides superior protection on a budget.

 Its design is one of the more divisive ones on our list, largely due to its utilitarian design that features a kickstand and a two-tone color palette where different materials connect. It also features a large cutout for the Apple logo on the back of the iPhone SE, which might not be to everyone's liking.

 Four available colors make it easier to find a design that you like, but there's no denying it's a bit bulkier than the competition. For shoppers on a budget, however, they'll be treated to a protective device that is bound to keep their iPhone safe for years to come.

| ✓ Built-in kickstand                   |         |

 TUCCH may not be as well known as some other case manufacturers, but the company is producing some of the best wallet cases money can buy. Built from a combination of faux leather and TPU, the [TUCCH iPhone SE Case](https://www.amazon.com/TUCCH-Kickstand-Magnetic-Interior-Compatible/dp/B074SDKBT9?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F791313%2Fbest-iphone-se-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is both easy on the eyes and capable of taking a beating.

 This case is tailormade to the iPhone SE 2022, with an interior shell that fits snuggly around the edges of your phone, acting as another layer of protection when the front flap is open and the iPhone is in use.

 As you'd expect from a wallet case, this one offers a variety of card slots and space for cash, along with a sleeve behind these pockets where you can store additional belongings.

 Rounding out the offerings you'll find a magnetic latch to keep the case closed when not in use, and the ability to use it as a kickstand when streaming movies or TV shows. All these features add up to a case that's a bit on the bulky side, but one that should offer plenty of functionality and protection.

 If you're planning to take your iPhone SE off the beaten track, you're going to want a reliable and durable case to keep it protected in the great outdoors. The [UAG Pathfinder](https://www.amazon.com/URBAN-ARMOR-GEAR-Lightweight-Shockproof/dp/B09TFYVXRZ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F791313%2Fbest-iphone-se-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) case for iPhone SE will do just that, without disrupting the wireless functionality that you love. 

 First off, this rugged case looks the business. This version in Military-style olive green isn't just for show, though, as the Pathfinder has been Military-Grade drop-tested to 16 feet, making it one tough hombre. 

 It's made from reinforced TPU and features a dual-layer design with extra impact protection built into its shock-absorbing corners. A tactile hex pattern adds some welcome grip, making it feel more secure in your hands, while its ultra-responsive clicky buttons feel responsive and satisfying to press. 

 The UAG Pathfinder is compatible with wireless charging and Apple Pay too, so there's no need to fiddle about removing it when you need to make a pit stop to get supplies for your next adventure. 

 Rugged protection with a slim and lightweight design, the UAG Pathfinder fits your iPhone SE like a glove and is the ideal way to keep it protected in the big wide open.

| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| ✓ Affordable                | ✗ Not the most durable of cases |
| ✓ Anti-yellowing components |                                 |
| ✓ Shock-absorbing corners   |                                 |

 If you're in love with the color and style of your iPhone SE, you won't want to slap a big ugly case over the top of it and spoil that sleek aesthetic. Better to invest in a transparent case like the [ESR Clear](https://www.amazon.com/ESR-iPhone-Shock-Absorbing-Scratch-Resistant-Polycarbonate/dp/B084KL1FST?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F791313%2Fbest-iphone-se-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which will preserve your phone's look, while still offering everyday protection against drops and scratch damage. 

 This clear case is made from scratch-resistant acrylic which has been treated with anti-yellowing properties to prevent any unwanted discoloration, making it a safe bet for long-lasting clarity. 

 It features shock-absorbing and Military-Grade tested Air-Guard corners that will comfortably bear the brunt of most drop damage. However, the rest of this slimline case isn't quite as durable, so it's worth bearing this in mind if you're looking for something with a bit more in terms of rugged protection.

 The ESR Clear has precision cutouts for all ports and speakers, is compatible with wireless charging, and makes a convenient and affordable choice for regular everyday use.

 Thin, affordable, and remarkably stylish, the [Spigen Thin Fit Case](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-iPhone-Premium-Surface-Excellent/dp/B01GIVWOMG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F791313%2Fbest-iphone-se-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a great option for iPhone SE owners who want to keep its sleek profile intact. Adding just 0.05-inches of depth, this basic case makes it easy to add protection to your phone without adding excess bulk.

 Scratch-resistant materials mean you don't have to worry about unwanted marks on the outside of the case, while its soft coating ensures your iPhone never slips out of your hand. Like most cases, the Spigen Thin Fit is offered in a variety of colors, including an eye-catching [Champagne Gold](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J94IX6A?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F791313%2Fbest-iphone-se-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [Rose Gold](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GIVWQZQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F791313%2Fbest-iphone-se-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 Thin cases typically don't offer as much protection as other types, and that holds true for this one as well. Exposed buttons and ports mean an unfortunate drop angle could result in damage, so anyone with a history of frequent phone drops might want to pick up something with a [bit more protection](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-check-if-your-infinix-hot-30i-is-unlocked-by-drfone-android/).

 Like [TUCCH](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/in-2024-essential-steps-for-sifting-through-facebook-videos/), Snakehive isn't a well-known iPhone accessories brand. That's quickly changing, however, thanks to its [Vintage Wallet Case](https://www.amazon.com/Snakehive-Vintage-Leather-Genuine-Viewing/dp/B087D5H5SX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F791313%2Fbest-iphone-se-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)\---a premium leather case that's arguably better looking than the iPhone SE itself.

 This wallet case is offered in a variety of two-tone designs, with a light interior accented by a variety of dark exteriors (including [Black](https://www.amazon.com/Snakehive-Vintage-Leather-Genuine-Viewing/dp/B087D5H5SX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F791313%2Fbest-iphone-se-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Blue](https://www.amazon.com/Snakehive-Vintage-Leather-Genuine-Viewing/dp/B087D5H5SX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F791313%2Fbest-iphone-se-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [Plum](https://www.amazon.com/Snakehive-Vintage-Leather-Genuine-Viewing/dp/B087D55B1J?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F791313%2Fbest-iphone-se-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), among others). Each case is handmade with top-grain leather for a stunning finish and includes a magnetic latch to keep the phone case closed when not in use.

 An inner case keeps your iPhone SE in place and safe from drops, although the outer leather might pick up a few bruises if it catches something sharp. That's nothing unique to the Snakehike, but rather a hazard of working with leather.

 Minor complaint aside, the Snakehike is a perfect fit for iPhone SE owners seeking a fashionable case that stands out from the pack.

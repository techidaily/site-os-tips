 Bulk transfer all or selected photos.  
 Preserve the original picture quality and album structure.  
 A Live Photo is converted to one video and one image file.  
**An HEIC photo** can be exported as a JPG for viewing on PC.  
 An edited photo is exported in 2 versions: original and edited.

1\. Launch DearMob iPhone Manager on PC. Connect your iOS/iPadOS device to your PC.  
 2\. Hit **Photo Transfer** and select the photo(s) you want to transfer to PC. Click **Export** and then you can find the photos on the local drive of your computer.

![](https://www.5kplayer.com/user-guide/images/userguide-how/tips-icon.png)**Tips:**

* Change view by grid size or group photos by date to better transfer and manage photos.
* Tick Export with Encryption to [encrypt the exported photo files](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/iphone-manager/).
* For photos tagged with a cloud icon, [follow this tutorial](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/iphone-manager/) to save the photos to your device first and continue to export them using DearMob

  
**Preview Photos by Albums**

DearMob iPhone Manage allows you to preview photos by album folders. There are favorites, Selfies, Screenshots, Panoramas, Bursts, Hidden, Recently Deleted, and folders created by different apps such as Snapchat, Instagram, Snapseed, etc.

* iPhone Manager version 5.8 and above support previewing the hidden Photos album. Photos in the Hidden album will not show up in the Camera Roll album.
* iPhone Manager version 6.5 and above support previewing photos that are directly imported from cameras, flash cards and other external drives into iPhone > Photos app.

![](https://www.5kplayer.com/user-guide/images/userguide-how/tips-icon.png)**More About the External Drive Album**

* You will see an External Drive album on the left panel inside the Photos module in DearMob. If your iPhone doesn't contain imported photos, you won't see the external drive album.
* The External Drive album in DearMob is different from the Imports folder on iPhone > Photos. The Imports folder contains photos via AirDrop, cameras, flash cards and other external drives, while the External Drive album in DearMob doesn't show AirDropped photos.
* You can find AirDropped photos in DearMob > Photos > Camera Roll. The photos received via AirDrop are organized based on their creation date. For example, if a friend AirDrops you a photo today that was taken a month ago, you'll need to locate the photo in last month's section of your camera roll in the Photos app.

In DearMob,

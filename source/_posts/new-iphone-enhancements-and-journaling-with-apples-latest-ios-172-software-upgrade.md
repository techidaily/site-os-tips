## New iPhone Enhancements & Journaling with Apple's Latest iOS 17.2 Software Upgrade

Apple [rolled out iOS 17 and iPadOS 17](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/enhanced-team-collaboration-with-slack-plus-filmora-timelines-for-2024/) earlier this year as a major update for iPhone and iPad devices. After a few weeks of beta testing, iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2 are now available, offering a new preinstalled app and some helpful features.

 The main new addition in iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2 is the new Journal app, which was [announced back in June](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-6-pure-android-screen-recorder-selections-no-ads-for-2024/) and was originally planned for the initial IOS 17 update, but was delayed until now. It's a journaling app that uses on-device machine learning to create "inspiration" for journal entries, which can be pictures you captured recently, music you listened to, or health data. The suggestion engine is [also an API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/JournalingSuggestions), so you might see other apps implement similar features on your iPhone or iPad (with your permission, of course).

 Apple said in a press release, "With Journal, it’s easy to get started by logging a simple text entry, or adding rich details like photos, videos, locations, or audio recordings to add more context. It’s just as easy to add content like a news article, music, or a podcast from other apps by bringing it into the Journal app and writing about it. Users can browse past entries, bookmark them, or filter for details like photos, workouts, places, and more. Scheduled notifications can help make journaling a consistent practice."

 The iOS 17.2 update also adds spatial video recording to the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro. The new mode will capture video with depth data, which will appear as 3D when viewed in the [upcoming Vision Pro headset](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-sharefake-location-on-whatsapp-for-apple-iphone-12-mini-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) and (presumably) other future Apple devices. There are improvements to system apps for iPhone and iPad, such as updates to stickers and Memoji in Messages, new widgets for Weather, and more. Apple also [backported Qi2 support to the iPhone 13 and 14](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/key-sites-for-innovative-font-design/), as we previously covered. The full list of changes is embedded below.

Step 1 Run Google Drive on your iPhone

 Connect to a Wi-Fi network. Download and install Google Drive from App Store on your iPhone. Now you are able to backup iPhone without a computer. Choose "Menu" icon in its left panel.

Step 2 Use Google Drive to backup content on your iPhone

 Click "Settings" gear icon from the top. Select "Backup" and choose the file type you want to make a backup including "Photos & Videos". Tap on "Start Backup" button and back up now.

 If you need to backup lots of photos from iPhone to Google Drive, this way will not work well, as only new photos will be backed up. And Google Drive will overwrite your precious backup files like iTunes does, including other data such as contacts and calendars.

 Because of various limitations, it obviously seems that FoneLab - iOS Data Backup & Restore can be the best option to backup iPhone to PC without hassle. Thus, if you don't want to use iTunes and iCloud to make iPhone backup, use iOS Data Backup & Restore to help you.

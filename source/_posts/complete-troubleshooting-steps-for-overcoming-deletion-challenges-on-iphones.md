## Where are my downloads

 Many iPhone users wonder that "Where are my downloads", so we can find download files and delete them.

And if you want to find your download history, you can install one download file manager app, and connect your iPhone with iTunes, and then you can access the download folder through the app on computer. Also, if you use some PDF/movies/music apps to download some files, you can find the downloads within the apps.

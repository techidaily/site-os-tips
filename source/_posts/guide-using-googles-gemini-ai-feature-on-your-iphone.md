 Gemini is Google's latest and greatest AI tool. A combination of Google Bard and Duet AI, it's set to rival ChatGPT and DALL-E 3\. You don't need an Android phone or a desktop browser to try it out. We'll show you how to use Gemini AI on your iPhone or iPad.

 As of the time of writing, there is not a dedicated Gemini app for iPhone and iPad. Instead, it's available in the official Google app. [Gemini is free to use](https://location-social.techidaily.com/does-find-my-friends-work-on-vivo-x90s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), but you can upgrade to [Gemini Advanced](https://gemini.google.com/advanced?utm%5Fsource=gemini&utm%5Fmedium=web&utm%5Fcampaign=gemini%5Fadvanced%5Fannounce%5Fsh) for $20 per month for more, well, _advanced_ features.

##  How to Use Google Gemini AI on iPhone

 Gemini began rolling out to the [Google app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942) for iPhone and iPad in early February 2024\. If you don't see what's shown in the screenshots below, you may need to wait a bit longer.

 First, open the Google app and look for "Gemini" in the top tabs. Select it to switch to Gemini.

 ...and that's it! Unlike Android, there's not much more you can do. Gemini is simply available as an alternative to Google Search.

##  How to Remove Gemini From the Google App on iPhone

 If you don't like Gemini showing up in the [Google app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942), you can choose to hide it. First, open the app and tap your profile icon in the top corner. Select "Settings" from the menu.

 Easy as that. No more AI in the Google app.

 Google's AI venture had a rocky start with Bard, but it has slowly become a legitimate competitor to ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot. Gemini can do [image generation](https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-from-novice-to-expert-your-path-in-google-photos/), [use extensions](https://fox-links.techidaily.com/in-2024-essential-compilation-top-8-4k-ultra-hd-players/), and more, though, like every AI product, [it's far from perfect](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-starting-point-connecting-seamlessly-via-instagram/).

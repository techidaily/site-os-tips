## How to Mount iPhone/iPad as a Flash Drive

In [DearMob iPhone Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/iphone-manager/), you can mount your iPhone or iPad as a flash drive. That is to say, any of your files, even including the documents that are not incompatible with Apple can be saved to your iPhone/iPad, and exported to another computer whenever you need. Compared with cloud storage, this method is safer, quicker, and independent of network connection.

## Store Files from a Computer to iPad/iPad Flash Drive

This PC-based iPhone manager lets you:  
 Mount your iPhone or iPad as a portable flash drive or a transfer station;  
 Store PPT, PDF, HTML, DOC, Word, Page, and anything on your iPhone/iPad;  
 Add Apple-incompatible files to your iDevice without installing any extra apps thereon;  
 No worries about those files on iDevices being noticed and viewed by others.

1\. Launch DearMob iPhone Manager and connect your iPhone or iPad to the source computer (the one which the files are going to be exported from).

2\. Click **Flash Drive** on the main interface.

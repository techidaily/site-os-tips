Here's how to check.

##  View a Saved Card in Safari

 First, open Settings on your iPhone or iPad.

 In Settings, tap "Safari."

 In Safari, tap "AutoFill."

 In Safari's AutoFill settings, tap "Saved Credit Cards."

![Tap "Saved Credit Cards."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-saved-credit-cards.png) 

 When prompted, enter your PIN or validate your identity with Touch ID or Face ID. After that, you'll see a list of credit cards that [Safari has saved in the past](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/how-to-overclock-your-cpu-a-beginners-guide/). Tap any entry in the list to see more details.

![Tap the card you want to modify or view.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-tap-credit-card.png) 

 On the details screen, you'll see the full credit card number and expiration date for the card if Safari has saved that information.

 While on the details screen, if you need to edit the information on the card, tap "Edit" in the upper-right corner.

![Tap the "Edit" button.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/6-click-the-edit-button.png) 

 When you're done editing, tap "Done."

![Delete the card if you want, or modify any details.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/7-delete-cc-1.png) 

 If you go back one screen to the credit card list, you can also add a credit card to the list by tapping "Add Credit Card" and entering the information, or you can delete a card from the list by tapping "Edit," selecting the card with a check mark, and tapping "Delete."

 When you're done, exit Settings. You now know where to look when you need to find your credit card number in a pinch. We hope that you find what you're looking for — good luck!

* You can edit or add credit card information in Safari's AutoFill settings and easily delete cards from the list.

 If you need access to your credit card number but don't have the actual card nearby, it's possible to get it from Safari — if it's been [previously stored](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/how-to-overclock-your-cpu-a-beginners-guide/) by Safari's AutoFill feature on your iPhone or iPad. Here's how to check.

 In Safari's AutoFill settings, tap "Saved Credit Cards."

![Tap "Saved Credit Cards."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-saved-credit-cards.png) 

 When prompted, enter your PIN or validate your identity with Touch ID or Face ID. After that, you'll see a list of credit cards that [Safari has saved in the past](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/how-to-overclock-your-cpu-a-beginners-guide/). Tap any entry in the list to see more details.

![Tap the card you want to modify or view.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-tap-credit-card.png) 

 On the details screen, you'll see the full credit card number and expiration date for the card if Safari has saved that information.

 While on the details screen, if you need to edit the information on the card, tap "Edit" in the upper-right corner.

![Tap the "Edit" button.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/6-click-the-edit-button.png) 

 When you're done editing, tap "Done."

![Delete the card if you want, or modify any details.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/7-delete-cc-1.png) 

 If you go back one screen to the credit card list, you can also add a credit card to the list by tapping "Add Credit Card" and entering the information, or you can delete a card from the list by tapping "Edit," selecting the card with a check mark, and tapping "Delete."

## Experience Seamless Song Recognition with Shazam on Your Private Stereo! Discover Music in Your Headphones Effortlessly.

Shazam now allows you to identify in-app music while wearing headphones. This feature is tailored toward TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube users who need a convenient way to identify songs. It works with wired or Bluetooth headphones on iOS and Android.

 In the past, Shazam could only identify in-app music if you cranked your phone's speakers. Shazam didn't introduce proper in-app song identification until July 2023, but the feature didn't work with headphones. Today's update rectifies this fault—if you come across a cool song on TikTok, you can Shazam it without removing your headphones. In-app song identification may not work in some apps, especially games.

> You can now identify music while wearing headphones (wired or Bluetooth). Simply open the app, check for the headphone icon to confirm your headphones are connected, and then start recognizing music around you or within apps like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.

 The in-app song identification feature works automatically. Open the Shazam app, press the big button, and navigate back to whatever app is playing music. You'll see a headphone icon in the Shazam app if it recognizes that you're wearing headphones. This functionality also works when using the Shazam shortcut in your iOS Control Center or Android Notification Bar. If you've placed a [Shazam widget](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/delete-gmail-account-withwithout-password-on-xiaomi-13t-by-drfone-android/) on your home screen, that'll work, too.

 Shazam will notify you when the song identification process is complete. You'll also receive a notification when this process fails (which usually means that the song can't be identified). If you need to see previously-identified songs, open the Shazam app and swipe up to expand the "My Music" shade. Timestamped versions of previously-identified songs can be found in the "Shazams" tab.

 Of course, Shazam can also identify any music that's playing _outside_ your headphones. You just need to pause any in-app audio before hitting the Shazam button.

 Update Shazam on [iOS](http://apps.apple.com/us/app/shazam-find-music-concerts/id284993459) or [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001783/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shazam.android&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) to unlock the new in-app song identification feature. This functionality works with both wired and Bluetooth headphones. If Shazam fails to identify a song that's playing through your headphones, see the app's [user guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/shazam/use-shazam-on-iphone-ipad-or-android-dev9748744b6/) for detailed instructions.

Step 3 After the system has been successfully restarted, connect your Kindle Fire device to your system.

Step 4 Go to your Windows Device Manager and look for "Android Composite ADB Interface" under "Kindle Fire". In case if it is not updated, you might see a yellow sign. It will simply ask you to update the interface which would take a few seconds.

Step 2 After connecting it, your system might ask you to install a few additional drivers. Click on the "install\_drivers.bat" file and it will commence the installation. Simply follow the on-screen instructions, as it might take a few minutes to install the needed drivers.

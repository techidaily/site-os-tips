### Key Takeaways

* visionOS 2.0 brings minor improvements to Apple's Vision Pro, but early adopters are still waiting for significant features.
* Despite small enhancements like spatial effects and better gestures, there is a disconnect between user expectations and reality.
* Apple should communicate a clearer roadmap for future updates to keep Vision Pro owners engaged and avoid abandonment concerns.

 At first, it was easy to see Apple’s Vision Pro as a technical marvel that was a leap into the future. But as a day-one owner, the improvements and new features have felt slow to arrive. Apple unveiled visionOS 2 at WWDC and, frankly, it doesn’t ease my concerns. I’m starting to get worried about the Vision Pro’s future.

##  Here's What visionOS 2.0 Brings to Vision Pro

 Version one of the operating system that launched with the Vision Pro was lacking. You couldn’t delete apps, rearrange them, or add them to folders. Plus Spatial Personas were a bit rough. [From my initial time with the device](https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/formulating-a-heartfelt-tiktok-epilogue-for-2024/), it was obvious that Apple made some sacrifices to just get the headset out the door. It wasn’t ideal, but it was fine.

 Unfortunately, [visionOS 2](https://www.apple.com/visionos/visionos-2-preview/) looks more like a point release than the next major operating system version. It brings things like adding spatial effects to 2D photos, mouse support, better gestures for notifications, and travel mode for trains.

 The software mostly contains fundamental features that early adopters have been begging for since February. The Vision Pro needed to get these enhancements, but even cumulatively they feel lackluster. It's hard to get excited about these things now arriving _until the fall._ This update doesn’t really instill confidence that Apple is prioritizing Vision Pro or moving at an engaged pace.

##  Features Are Missing, But Expectations Are Misaligned

 There’s a significant chasm between what visionOS 2 brings and what Vision Pro owners hoped it would be. People who were willing to fork over $3,500 are early adopters who are generally unsatisfied with the slow pace of break-neck technology. They, myself included, can’t get enough new features quickly enough. Why are new Environments taking so long? Will we really have to wait until the fall for that simple feature? There’s a disconnect that Apple needs to overtly address.

 I’m not even disappointed with these new software enhancements being announced. I am, however, deeply worried that a disappointing visionOS 2 means that there won’t be any significant new features until next year at WWDC 2025\. Will Vision Pro owners need to wait another 15 months to get visionOS 3 on our devices? That won’t fly, but that’s the indication based on updates since the headset's launch and Apple’s yearly software track record.

##  These Are the Things to Get Excited About

 Before I spiral down too far, it’s worth highlighting what there is to get excited about. The most obvious thing is better support for Mac Virtual Display. There will be new wide-screen options that will be able to stretch up to the equivalent of two 4K displays next to each other. That's rad.

 I'm also excited about improvements to guest mode and keyboard breakthrough, where you can see the keyboard in environments, but these are small, minor things. That's how desperate I am for new features. For developers, there are new ways to help make their apps better like TabletopKit and Enterprise APIs.

##  What’s Next for visionOS?

 Apple’s developer conference came and went without a big focus on the company’s latest cutting-edge product. The event highlighted that there are still a lot of concerning shortcomings of the Vision Pro. I didn't expect every desire to be met, but I also hoped Apple would be more enthusiastic about it. Instead of leaving a lingering void around it.

 Current owners are worried that if there’s not an injection of enthusiasm into visionOS (Vision Pro) from Apple then a vicious cycle could form where developers stop adopting the platform to build apps, potential consumers don’t see value, and sales dry up. Following that path, Apple eventually abandons the Vision Pro and owners are left with an expensive paperweight.

 To be clear, I don’t think we’re there yet. There’s still time for the headset to become the must-have gadget. But it’s been a year since the Vision Pro was announced and time to catch fire has an expiration date.

 One way for Apple to better control the narrative around the Vision Pro is to better communicate its roadmap—in a way it doesn’t need to for other products. If I knew visionOS 2.5 would arrive before the end of 2024 and bring a steady flow of meaningful updates, I’d be more comfortable with the low-hanging fruit that 2 is addressing today. Will we only get one OS update a year like other products? How many point releases will be coming?

 Early adopters (anyone buying a Vision Pro today) can be a fickle bunch, always wanting to move on to the next thing. We can be placated, but we just need to _know_ that things are coming. Apple, don’t leave us in the dark and let us go searching for the next thing.

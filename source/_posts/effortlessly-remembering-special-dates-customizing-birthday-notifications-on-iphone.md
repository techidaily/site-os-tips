##  How to Enable Birthday Notifications on iPhone

 First, for this to work, you must have [notifications enabled](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-clear-black-boards-in-your-youtube-videos/) for the Calendar app. To turn that on, visit Settings > Notifications > Calendar and set the switch beside "Allow Notifications" to "On."

 If you don't see "Calendar" in the Notifications menu, that means the Calendar app has never requested permission to send you notifications. Typically, this will occur because you've never opened the Calendar app before.

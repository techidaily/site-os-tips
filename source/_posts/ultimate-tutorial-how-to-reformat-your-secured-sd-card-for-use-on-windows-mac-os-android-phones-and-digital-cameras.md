And if you really need to backup something, these offered free storages are not enough. When you want to purchase a cloud backup service, you should compare the prices and then make your decision.

**Do you upload private or sensitive data to the cloud service?**

 When you back up some personal information to external hard drive, you feel safe and don't care too much about the information leaks.

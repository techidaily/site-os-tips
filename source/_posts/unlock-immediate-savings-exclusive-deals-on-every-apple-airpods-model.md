## Unlock Immediate Savings: Exclusive Deals on Every Apple AirPods Model

With discounts on all AirPod models, it's time to give your audio experience an upgrade, especially if you're already part of the Apple ecosystem.

 There's no denying the popularity of AirPods, especially as an Apple user. But they are also very expensive. Thankfully, all versions of the Apple AirPods are on a discount, so you can pick up a pair without emptying your wallet.

 The AirPods model seeing the biggest discount are the standard [2nd Generation Apple AirPods](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002242&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fairpods-sale%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), which you can pick up for $99.99, 23% off the normal price at Amazon. These AirPods are great as an entry point to the brand, as they offer a lot of functionality of the AirPods Pro at a much lower cost. If you're looking for the [3rd Generation AirPods](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHB9Y8H?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002242&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fairpods-sale%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), they're also on sale, albeit only $20 off.

 That said, the standard AirPods are missing a few features that might be important to you, such as IP54 water resistance and a longer battery life. In that case, you'll want to pick up the [Apple AirPods Pro](https://www.walmart.com/ip/AirPods-Pro-2nd-generation-with-MagSafe-Case-USB-C/5020133971), which are currently on sale for $199 for the USB-C charging model at Walmart. This is a great price for a great pair of earbuds, with the H2 audio chip pumping out fantastic audio, and touch controls on the stem making it easy to control the music without pulling out your phone. We also name them our top recommendation for the [best earbuds for iPhone and iPad](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-use-special-features-virtual-location-on-xiaomi-civi-3-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/)!

 Finally, let's not forget about the AirPods Max. These over-ear headphones have always been high-priced compared to other active noise-cancelling ([ANC](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-sharing-twitch-on-your-fb-page-for-2024/)) headphones, but are more in line with 'audiophile' headphone sets. But our reviewer thought the [AirPods Max were worth the high cost of entry](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/how-to-change-powerpoint-video-speed/):

 For me, the higher cost is worth it due to the way they fit on my head and the comfort alone. The superb build quality and ANC capabilities may be a reason you pick them up versus their competitors.

 With all that in mind, being able to save nearly $70 on a pair makes these great headphones an even sweeter deal.

### Key Takeaways

 To delete duplicate contacts on iPhone, open the "Contacts" app and use the "View Duplicates" option. You can merge contacts one by one or all at once.

 It's easy for the contacts on your iPhone or iPad to get unorganized. Thankfully, there are multiple ways to deal with messy contacts, especially pesky duplicates. We'll show you how to merge duplicate contacts or delete duplicates entirely.

 Duplicate contacts are especially a problem if you're bringing in contacts from multiple sources, such as Google and [iCloud](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-urban-uprising-video-game-list-like-gta-v/). Rather than having people from both lists appear twice, you can find duplicate contacts and merge them together. Or maybe you only want to keep one of them. Let's do it.

##  How to Remove Duplicate Contacts on iPhone

 Apple didn't always include a tool for merging duplicate contacts. Thankfully, the functionality is now built into the Contacts app as of [iOS 16](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/2024-approved-youtubes-top-12-choices-in-gamers-introductory-videos-freepaid/). It's not perfect, but it should catch most of the duplicates.

 First, open the "Contacts" app on your iPhone or iPad.

![Tap the &quot;Contacts&quot; app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0187.png) 

 Next, go to "All Contacts" if you're not already there.

![Select &quot;All Contacts.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0188.png)

 If duplicates have been found, you'll see a card at the top of the screen. Tap "View Duplicates."

![Select &quot;View Duplicates.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0189.png)

 Select the contact you'd like to merge, or tap "Merge All" to merge them all at once.

![Select a contact or &quot;Merge All.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0190a.png) 

 If you select an individual contact, you'll see where the duplicates are being pulled from. In this case, I have the same contact listed twice [from my synced Google account](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-clip-groove-best-bgm-choices-for-todays-popular-yt-shorts/). It also shows which information will be merged. Tap "Merge."

![Tap &quot;Merge.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0191.png) 

 Then select "Merge" from the pop-up to confirm.

![Select &quot;Merge.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0194a.png) 

 That's all there is to it! Apple's built-in feature is pretty good if you don't have a ton of contacts to sift through.

##  How to Use an App to Merge Duplicate Contacts on iPhone

 Apple's tool for merging contacts is decent, but it doesn't always catch duplicates. You may want to use a third-party app to get the job done. We like a free app called "[Easy Cleaner](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/easy-cleaner/id519077149)"---it has over 24K reviews and a nearly five-star rating.

 First, open the app and give it permission to access your contacts. Tap "Continue" and then "OK."

![Tap &quot;Continue&quot; and &quot;OK.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0195-1.png) 

 Next, the app has a feature called "Contacts Enrichment." You do not need to enable this for our purposes.

![Contacts Enrichment is optional.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0197.png) 

 Now we're in the main interface of the app. Tap "Duplicate Contacts."

![Select &quot;Duplicate Contacts.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0198.png) 

 Select the contact you'd like to merge.

![Select a contact.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0199-1.png) 

 Here you'll see the information that will be merged together. Next, tap "Merge" or "Merge All Duplicates" if you'd like to do them all at once.

![Select &quot;Merge.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0200.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




 You're all set! This tool works slightly better than Apple's built-in feature in the Contacts app.

##  How to Delete Contacts on iPhone

 What if you just want to delete a contact, not merge it? That's very easy to do from the Contacts app. Simply find the contact you'd like to delete and press and hold.

![Press and hold on a contact from the list.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0201.png)

 From the menu, select "Delete Contact."

##  How to Delete Multiple Contacts on iPhone

[Deleting multiple contacts](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-live-stream-providers-with-10-top-insights/) is a little trickier. Apple doesn't let you select multiple contacts. You can tap with two fingers and drag to highlight, but that's not great for selecting at will. For that, we'll be using a free app called "[Easy Cleaner](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/easy-cleaner/id519077149)."

 First, open the app and give it permission to access your contacts. Tap "Continue" and then "OK."

![Tap &quot;Continue&quot; and &quot;OK.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0195-1.png)

 Select "All Contacts" at the top of the screen.

 Tap and hold one contact to select them, then select other contacts to delete.

![Press and hold a contact, then select more.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0204.png) 

 With all the contacts you want to delete highlighted, tap the trash icon in the bottom right corner.

![Tap the trash can icon.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2023-02-03_15-44-08.png) 

 Confirm by selecting "Delete."

![Tap &quot;Delete&quot; to confirm.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0205.png) 

 That's it! This is a much better way to delete multiple contacts at once.

##  Disable Contacts Associated with Email Accounts

 Another easy way to clean up your contacts list is by disabling lists associated with your email accounts. Not all of these contacts are useful, so consider decluttering.

 You can do so by going to Settings > Contacts > Accounts. Then, tap the account in question and toggle "Contacts" off.

![Disable contacts functionality for a Gmail account](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/disable_contacts_account.jpg) 

 When you do this, all contacts associated with that account will be deleted from your phone. However, they will remain on the server you downloaded them from, such as Google Contacts.

 Contact management is something that most of us probably don't do very often. Thankfully, phones have gotten a lot better at helping us with this task. It's easy to [merge duplicate contacts on an Android device](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-streamlined-steps-to-document-chat-calls-on-whatsapp/). Using Apple Photos, you can also [find and delete duplicate photos and videos](https://ai-topics.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-what-is-chatgpt/), too.

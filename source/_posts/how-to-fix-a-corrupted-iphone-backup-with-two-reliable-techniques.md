## Part 4 . How to Backup iPhone to Computer with Google Drive

![Backup iPhone to Computer](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/ios-data-backup-and-restore/backup-iphone-to-google-drive.jpg)

 If you need to backup lots of photos from iPhone to Google Drive, this way will not work well, as only new photos will be backed up. And Google Drive will overwrite your precious backup files like iTunes does, including other data such as contacts and calendars.

 Because of various limitations, it obviously seems that FoneLab - iOS Data Backup & Restore can be the best option to backup iPhone to PC without hassle. Thus, if you don't want to use iTunes and iCloud to make iPhone backup, use iOS Data Backup & Restore to help you.

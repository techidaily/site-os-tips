## Expert Tips for Hiding the Do Not Disturb Indicator From Your iPhone 15 Pro Screen

### Key Takeaways

* Apple has added a bell icon in the status bar on the iPhone 15 Pro models to help users tell when their device is in Silent mode.
* If you find it pointless, you can remove the Silent mode icon by toggling a switch in the Sound & Haptics settings menu.

 With the removal of the Mute switch on the iPhone 15 Pro series, Apple has added a crossed-out bell icon in the status bar to help users tell when their device is in Silent mode. This is pointless if you always have your iPhone muted. Thankfully, it's possible to hide it.

##  Hide the Silent Mode Icon From Your iPhone 15 Pro's Status Bar

 It's pretty easy to remove the Silent mode icon from your iPhone's status bar. First, open the Settings app on your iPhone. Then, go into "Sounds & Haptics."

 Finally, under "Silent Mode," toggle off the switch next to "Show in Status Bar."

 After this, the Silent mode icon will no longer appear in your iPhone's status bar, even if it's active. This change applies to both the Lock Screen and the Home Screen.

##  A Better Way to Check the Silent Mode Status

 With the bell icon hidden from the status bar, you can now check whether your iPhone is in Silent mode from the [Control Center](https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ring-how-tseries-harnesses-revenue-from-online-viewer-base-youtube/). Simply swipe down from the top-right of the screen to reveal the Control Center and check the status of the bell icon to the right of the Screen Rotation control. Tap it to toggle mute on or off.

 Thanks to the addition of the Silent mode control in the Control Center, you no longer need to use the [iPhone 15 Pro](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-direct-interaction-enhancing-live-broadcasts-with-desktop-share/) Action Button to toggle Silent mode. As such, you can remap the Action Button to other useful actions, like performing translations or running your favorite shortcuts.

 If you’ve ever had to edit and format a PDF for work or school, you know what a tricky task this can be. That’s where [UPDF’s AI-integrated PDF Editor](https://updf.com/updf-special-offer-media-t/?utm%5Fsource=media&utm%5Fmedium=howtogeek-newsletter2-09&utm%5Fcampaign=taylor202309) comes in. From now until November 6th, you’ll be able to save 58% on both lifetime access to the PDF editor itself and a year long subscription for the AI add-on.

 With UPDF, you can edit PDFs as if they’re Word documents. It grants you the ability to add and delete text at will, change the font, modify existing images, add new ones, and much more. You’ll also be able to sign PDFs, annotate them with “stickers”, and convert them into Word docs, JPGs, and other formats. And the optional AI add-on is great for summarizing any data charts within the PDF, finding grammatical and spelling errors, and beyond.

 Compatibility shouldn’t be an issue, as [UPDF PDF Editor](https://updf.com/updf-special-offer-media-t/?utm%5Fsource=media&utm%5Fmedium=howtogeek-newsletter2-09&utm%5Fcampaign=taylor202309) works with Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android alike. And you have the option to enable it on up to four different devices at once. This program also happens to be nice and lightweight so you won’t have to worry about it slowing down your electronics during use.

 Don’t miss out on this chance to get lifetime access to [UPDF PDF Editor](https://updf.com/updf-special-offer-media-t/?utm%5Fsource=media&utm%5Fmedium=howtogeek-newsletter2-09&utm%5Fcampaign=taylor202309) for 58% off; you’ll only pay $47.99 instead of the usual $109.99\. If you want the UPDF pro with AI add-on, a year long subscription to that feature is normally $148.99 but currently costs only $66.99\. Better yet, if you take advantage of this offer on UPDF PDF Editor with AI Add-On, the price won’t go up next year; you’ll still get the 58% discount if you choose to renew your subscription.

![New Project (85)](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/new-project-85.jpg) 

#####  Microsoft Office Pro 2021 for Windows: Lifetime License + Windows 11 Pro Bundle

$49.96 $418.99 Save $369.03 

Get the convenient bundle your PC has been waiting for at an incredible deal.

[Buy on StackSocial](https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/24-supercharge-videos-download-premium-effs/) 

 If you own a Windows PC, be it for work or personal use, don't miss out on this chance to upgrade your operating system to Windows 11 Professional _and_ gain lifetime access to Microsoft Office Professional for Windows with the [Office Pro/Windows 11 Pro bundle](https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/24-supercharge-videos-download-premium-effs/) that's currently available for a fraction of the usual price; this bundle normally runs $418.99, but from now through October 1st, you can snag it for only $49.96—yes, you read that right—it's an 88% discount and less than half of what either program alone normally costs.

 Upgrading to Microsoft Windows 11 Pro and its myriad features is well worth the investment. This includes Background Blur and Automatic Framing, improved voice typing, TPM 2.0 to prevent outside tampering, BitLocker device encryption for greater security (a Windows 11 Pro exclusive), and the ability to create your own custom layouts. And thanks to Windows 11 Pro's touchscreen function, you can even operate your computer sans a keyboard or mouse.

 Microsoft Office Pro for Windows is nothing to sneeze at, either. While it's not Microsoft 365, you'll still get Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, OneNote, Teams, Publisher, and Access. You'll be able to download and install your new software right away and have access to free software updates and Microsoft's customer service for your troubleshooting needs. And you receive lifetime access as well, so it's a one-time purchase, with no yearly subscription fees to worry about.

 Keep in mind that [this bundle](https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/24-supercharge-videos-download-premium-effs/) is only for Windows PCs. Mac users, unfortunately, are out of luck. If you do own a Windows computer, make sure to [check that it's compatible with the Windows 11 upgrade](https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/windows-11-compatibility-checker/) and that you use the code you receive within 30 days of purchase. And Microsoft Office Pro can only be installed on one computer, so be sure to install it on the laptop or desktop you use the most.

The [Apple Watch Series 8](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHQD1CQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000489&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fdont-miss-these-savings-on-updf-editor-the-apple-watch-series-8-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) keeps the tried and tested design of the Series 7 but adds temperature sensors and the Crash Detection feature. Get it at its best price.

[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHQD1CQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000489&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fdont-miss-these-savings-on-updf-editor-the-apple-watch-series-8-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) 

 Whether you're an experienced runner, just starting out on your new fitness journey, or trying to keep better track of your workout, a smartwatch is one of the best tools for monitoring your run and swim times, overall progress, and health metrics. If you're in the market for a new smartwatch, for fitness or otherwise, the [Apple Watch Series 8](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHQD1CQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000489&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fdont-miss-these-savings-on-updf-editor-the-apple-watch-series-8-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is well worth your consideration, [especially if you already own an iPhone](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/voice-recording-mastery-with-ipad-tools/), as it effortlessly pairs with other Apple devices and services.

 This smartwatch will not only keep track of your heart rate, oxygen, activity levels, and other exercise metrics, but it also has a built-in Workout app to help with training and reaching your fitness goals of all sorts. Unlike some fitness watches, this model is swim-proof and highly water-resistant for aquatic workouts, making it a great option for anyone who prefers swimming laps or doing water aerobics. It's crack-resistant and IP6X-certified dust-resistant as well, providing greater durability overall.

 Apple also offers a complimentary three free months of Apple Fitness+ with your purchase to give you access to a wider range of workouts and fitness classes right on your wrist. That said, the [Apple Watch Series 8](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHQD1CQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000489&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fdont-miss-these-savings-on-updf-editor-the-apple-watch-series-8-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) isn't limited solely to serving as a fitness watch, either. It's capable of receiving calls and texts, offers access to Apple Pay and thousands of other apps in the Apple store, tracks your sleep cycle, offers fall and [crash detection](https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/ipogo-will-be-the-new-ispoofer-on-tecno-camon-30-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) for your personal safety, and much more.

#####  Samsung Galaxy S23+

$799.99 $999.99 Save $200 

The [Samsung S23+](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BLP4J9RR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000489&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fdont-miss-these-savings-on-updf-editor-the-apple-watch-series-8-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is an Android phone with awesome specs at a fairly good price, making it perfect for most people. Now is a great time to get it.

[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BLP4J9RR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000489&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fdont-miss-these-savings-on-updf-editor-the-apple-watch-series-8-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) 

 If it's time to trade in your old Android phone for a new one or if you want to switch from iPhone to Android, now is a great time to buy the [Samsung Galaxy S23+](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BLP4J9RR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000489&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fdont-miss-these-savings-on-updf-editor-the-apple-watch-series-8-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) and save yourself a couple hundred dollars in the process. While it may not be the Samsung Galaxy 23 Ultra, there's still a lot to love about this smartphone.

 With 256GB of storage space, you'll have plenty of room on this phone for apps, photos, videos, and games galore. It's a good thing, too, since the 50MP high-resolution camera is top-notch. Whether you're taking selfies with the updated 2MP selfie camera, snapping photos in near-darkness with Night Mode, or taking advantage of its other various camera settings—such as Multi-Exposure and Director's View—your pictures will come out clear and crisp, even in environments with poor lighting.

 The phone's battery life is nothing to sneeze at, either. The 4700mAh battery is nice and long-lasting; [we found it has the potential to last around a day and a half](https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-binge-worthy-battles-discovering-the-viral-tiktok-top-10-for-2024/), even with regular use. You'll be able to stream your favorite shows and videos on the 6.6-inch display screen for longer stretches of time without interruption. And when the time does come to recharge the [Samsung Galaxy S23+](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BLP4J9RR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000489&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fdont-miss-these-savings-on-updf-editor-the-apple-watch-series-8-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), it supports 45W super-fasting charging (with the proper, sold separately wall charger), so you won't have to wait much more than an hour for your new smartphone to be fully juiced and back in action.

[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0912JT6R1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000489&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fdont-miss-these-savings-on-updf-editor-the-apple-watch-series-8-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) 

 Smartwatches can serve many different functions, though many people seek them out for fitness purposes above all else. If you're in the market for a new fitness watch, the [Garmin Venu 2 Smartwatch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0912JT6R1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000489&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fdont-miss-these-savings-on-updf-editor-the-apple-watch-series-8-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is well worth a look.

 Though it lacks some of the extra features other smartwatches possess, such as the ability to control your smart home devices or access digital voice assistants, [there's still plenty to recommend this watch](https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/find-friends-in-fandoms-forums/). You will be able to receive calls and texts on it should you choose to pair it with your Android or Apple phone, as well as download music and use the Garmin Pay app to make purchases with just the flick of your wrist.

 That said, the main draw of this smartwatch is its ability to track your fitness and health goals, and it performs these tasks admirably. It can keep tabs on all the usual fitness and health features that many smartwatches have, such as heart rate, step count, and sleep cycles, among others. But it also offers more advanced versions of these features, including ([but hardly limited to](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/707572#specs)) advanced sleep detection, advice on how to get better sleep, hydration levels, and a relaxation timer to remind yourself when you need to take a break.

 In terms of exercise, this watch offers a true cornucopia of sports apps (25 total) to monitor your progress on a wide variety of workouts. Whether you're jogging, swimming, rowing indoors, cycling, golfing, or doing a HIIT, yoga, or Pilates workout, the [Garmin Venu 2 Smartwatch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0912JT6R1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000489&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fdont-miss-these-savings-on-updf-editor-the-apple-watch-series-8-and-more%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) will track all these activities with detailed metrics specifically for the sport or activity in question. And not only will it tell you approximately how many calories you've burned in a session, but it'll keep tabs on your workout intensity levels, automatically count your reps, offer preloaded cardio and strength workouts, and [much more](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/707572#specs).

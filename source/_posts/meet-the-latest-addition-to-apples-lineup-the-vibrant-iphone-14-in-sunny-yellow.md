## Meet the Latest Addition to Apple's Lineup: The Vibrant iPhone 14 in Sunny Yellow

Apple introduced the [iPhone 14](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/complete-review-for-hero4-black/) and [iPhone 14 Pro](https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/-up-the-screen-techniques-for-stunning-youtube-visuals/) in September 2022, but if you didn't already buy one, Apple is hoping a new color option might win you over. Two of the models are now available in a bright yellow color.

 Apple has revealed a new yellow color for both the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, which will be available to pre-order this Friday, March 10\. Full availability starts on Tuesday, March 14\. The phones were already available in "Midnight" (black), "Starlight" (beige/white), Product RED, blue, and purple. The existing colors didn't stand out from the crowd much, except the bright red of the Product RED option, so it's nice to see a bright yellow option enter the lineup.

Apple

 Apple hasn't sold iPhones in a yellow color since the [iPhone 11](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP804?locale=en%5FUS) in 2019, and before that, the iPhone XR from 2018 had a yellow option. Apple normally limits its Pro-branded products to understated or dim colors, and that trend is sadly still going -- you cannot buy a banana-colored iPhone 14 Pro.

 It's not unusual for Apple to introduce new color options for products that have already been released, and the company is probably hoping for a temporary sales boost. [Apple's financial results for the last quarter of 2023](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/apple-aapl-earnings-q4-2022.html) showed a slump in iPhone sales, but availability of some models (especially the iPhone 14 Pro) was constrained by supply chain problems.

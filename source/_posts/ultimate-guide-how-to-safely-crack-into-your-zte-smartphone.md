## Part 1\. Why Is My iPhone Volume So Low - 7 Reasons Behind It

 When your iPhone's sound is low, there could be several reasons why it happens. Before you jump to a conclusion or assume that there is a hardware problem, consider these potential causes first.

### 1\. Media Volume Settings

 One of the most common reasons volume is low is accidentally adjusting the media volume slider. When you are playing media, pressing the volume buttons on the side helps you to adjust the volume precisely. Pressing the volume down button can decrease the volume of what is playing on your iPhone.

### 2\. Do Not Disturb Mode

 Why is the iPhone ring volume low? Disturb mode might lower the volume of your notifications, rings, and calls. When this mode is activated, the name suggests it all, and no notification can be heard on your iPhone since you do not want to be disturbed.

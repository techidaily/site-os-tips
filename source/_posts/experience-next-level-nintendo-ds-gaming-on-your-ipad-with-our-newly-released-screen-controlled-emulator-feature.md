## Experience Next-Level Nintendo DS Gaming on Your iPad with Our Newly Released Screen-Controlled Emulator Feature

Tired of using Delta emulator on your puny little iPhone? Well, Delta is now optimized for iPad, and it comes with some interesting features to make DS games more manageable.

 The Delta 1.6 update introduces full-screen compatibility and a collection of new controller skins for iPad. While the emulator could already be downloaded on iPad, it couldn't play at full screen, so it was relatively useless as an iPad app.

 Okay, great, we've got Delta emulator on iPad. The only problem is that DS games look really awkward on an iPad in landscape mode. We can spit the DS' screens into separate app windows on iPad (just as we could on iPhone), but this isn't always an ideal solution.

 Delta 1.6 introduces some new screen-management functionality to make up for this problem. You can now split each screen of the DS into a separate app window—you can jump between each app window by swiping left or right on the bottom edge of your screen, or you can set the two windows into Split View and adjust their size on the fly.

 Separate app windows can also be accessed through [Stage Manager](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-12-best-tycoon-games-guaranteed-to-hook-you/), an oft-forgotten feature that seems perfect for this particular use case. And if you're tolerant of latency, you can use AirPlay to beam one of the DS screens to a TV, another iPad, or a Mac. Someone on Reddit used the AirPlay trick to turn their iPad and MacBook into [a giant Nintendo DS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Delta%5FEmulator/comments/1e3mqf7/this%5Fis%5Fsuch%5Fa%5Fgreat%5Fway%5Fto%5Fplay%5Fds%5Fgames/).

 Additionally, Delta allows you to quickly switch between your iPhone and iPad with [Handoff](https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/guide-to-correcting-windows-10-issue-0xc19001e1-for-a-stable-operating-environment/). It's a pretty compelling feature, although I'm not sure how well it works.

 Other improvements include the ability to "insert" GBA games into a DS (some GBA games [benefit](https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/List%5Fof%5FNintendo%5FDS%5Fgames%5Fwith%5FGBA%5Fconnectivity) from this), a 3x fast-forward speed, and quick action menu gestures—hold the "menu" button and swipe horizontally to fast-forward, for example.

 And, interestingly, Delta no longer requires BIOS files for games. This does not mean that BIOS files are included with Delta (at least, I hope not), as the third-party distribution of such files violates copyright law. For reference, most GameBoy and DS games only use the BIOS file to show the console bootup screen.

 Eagle-eyed users will also notice that Delta is using a new logo. The old logo, which was just the Greek letter "delta" with a hole in the bottom, led to a [legal threat](https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/24159268/delta-emulator-logo-change-app) from Adobe. (Ironically, the new logo looks a lot like the top half of a capital "A," which is what Adobe's logo is supposed to represent.)

 A full list of Delta v1.6 changes can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta/releases/tag/v1.6).

 You can install the updated [Delta emulator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688) from the iOS App Store. Of course, gamers who live in the EU can also download this app from the [AltStore](https://fosstodon.org/@altstore/112764037770811929).

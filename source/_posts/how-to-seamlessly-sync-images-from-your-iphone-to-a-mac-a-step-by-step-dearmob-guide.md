## How to Transfer Photos between iPhone and Mac

[DearMob iPhone Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/iphone-manager/) lets you transfer photos to or from iOS and iPadOS devices in a fast, easy, and safe manner. Whether they are Live Photos, ProRaw, burst photos, 4K HDR photos, or HEIC, all kinds of iPhone photos can be imported or exported to the iPhone in original resolution.

 An edited photo is exported in 2 versions: original and edited.

1\. Launch DearMob iPhone Manager and connect your iOS/iPadOS device.  
 2\. Hit **Photo Transfer** and select the photo(s) you want to transfer to Mac. Click **Export** and then you can find the photos on the local drive of your computer.

* Change view by grid size or group photos by date to better transfer and manage photos.
* Tick Export with Encryption to [encrypt the exported photo files](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/iphone-manager/).
* For photos tagged with a cloud icon, [follow this tutorial](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/iphone-manager/) to save the photos to your device first and continue to export them using DearMob.

  
**Preview Photos by Albums**

DearMob iPhone Manage allows you to preview photos by album folders. There are favorites, Selfies, Screenshots, Panoramas, Bursts, Hidden, Recently Deleted, and folders created by different apps such as Snapchat, Instagram, Snapseed, etc.

* iPhone Manager version 5.8 and above support previewing the hidden Photos album. Photos in the Hidden album will not show up in the Camera Roll album.
* iPhone Manager version 6.5 and above support previewing photos that are directly imported from cameras, flash cards and other external drives into iPhone > Photos app.

![](https://www.5kplayer.com/user-guide/images/userguide-how/tips-icon.png)**More About the External Drive Album**

* You will see an External Drive album on the left panel inside the Photos module in DearMob. If your iPhone doesn't contain imported photos, you won't see the external drive album.
* The External Drive album in DearMob is different from the Imports folder on iPhone > Photos. The Imports folder contains photos via AirDrop, cameras, flash cards and other external drives, while the External Drive album in DearMob doesn't show AirDropped photos.
* You can find AirDropped photos in DearMob > Photos > Camera Roll. The photos received via AirDrop are organized based on their creation date. For example, if a friend AirDrops you a photo today that was taken a month ago, you'll need to locate the photo in last month's section of your camera roll in the Photos app.

## Transfer Photos from Mac to iPhone, iPad, or iPod Photos

In DearMob,  
**Photo Formats** include .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp, .tiff, and .heic.  
**Import HEIC** to iPhone.  
 Undo Option allows you to click the red curve icon or cancel button for avoiding the wrong import before Sync. 

1\. Launch DearMob iPhone Manager and connect your iPhone to your computer.  
 2\. Click **Photo Transfer**. Scroll down on the album list to find the **+** icon. Click it to create a new album. Open the new album.  
 3\. Click **Add Photo** and select the photos or photo folders that you want to import from Mac to iPhone. Alternatively, drag the photos or photo folders into the large blank area.  
 4\. Click the **Sync** button to start transferring photos from Mac to iPhone.

![Remove Photo Location Data](https://www.5kplayer.com/user-guide/images/userguide-how/remove-photo-location-data-mac.jpg) 
* By default, the option is turned off. When you export photos, the embedded location data in the photos will be kept.

* iPhones and other smartphones with GPS capabilities can record the latitude and longitude coordinates of the device's location at the time the photo was captured.

## June Showdown: Apple Unveils What's Next at the 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference

Apple’s biggest event every year is the Worldwide Developers Conference, or WWDC for short. It’s where the company usually reveals new major software updates, and occasionally new hardware, and now Apple has announced WWDC 2024.

 Apple revealed today that the annual Worldwide Developers Conference will be held online from June 10 to June 14, 2024\. Just like last year’s WWDC, there will be a limited in-person special event on June 10, but all the keynotes and sessions will be available to watch online.

 Apple had a lot to show off during last year’s WWDC: a [new 15-inch MacBook Air](https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-revealing-hidden-group-media-on-messenger-app/), the [M2 Mac Pro and Mac Studio](https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-all-you-need-to-know-about-mega-greninja-for-poco-m6-pro-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), [iOS 17 and iPadOS 17](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/enhanced-team-collaboration-with-slack-plus-filmora-timelines-for-2024/), [macOS 14 Sonoma](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/how-to-capture-your-gaming-success-on-win10/), [watchOS 10](https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ghostly-3-melee-golem-4s-challenge/), and the [Apple Vision Pro headset](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-sharefake-location-on-whatsapp-for-apple-iphone-12-mini-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/). It’s a safe assumption that we’ll see macOS 15, iOS and iPadOS 18, and watchOS 11 in the upcoming June event, but we don’t have a great idea of that those updates will entail. A [few reports](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/) point to new AI features, which could give the Siri voice assistant a much-needed boost.

 Apple said in a press release, “Free for all developers, WWDC24 will spotlight the latest iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS advancements. As part of Apple’s ongoing commitment to helping developers elevate their apps and games, the event will also provide them with unique access to Apple experts, as well as insight into new tools, frameworks, and features.”

 The main keynote will be streamed live on [Apple's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Apple), the [Apple Events website](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/), and the [Apple Developer app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-developer/id640199958). The company also just created an [Apple Developer YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AppleDeveloper/videos) today, which is likely where the developer session will be posted, alongside the usual placement in the Developer app.

 If this year’s WWDC event is all about generative AI, as rumors suggest, it will be interesting to see how the company integrates AI features across its devices. Microsoft’s approach has been to stick a Copilot window in every application and in the Windows taskbar, and Google has tried replacing Assistant with its new [Gemini AI](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/24-unleash-creativity-without-breaking-the-bank-top-9-affordable-editors/) (with [mixed results](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-starting-point-connecting-seamlessly-via-instagram/)). Hopefully, Apple taking its time with AI integration means the features will be a bit more polished.

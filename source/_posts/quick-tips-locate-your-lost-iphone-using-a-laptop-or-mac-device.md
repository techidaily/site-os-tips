 Remove the two screws at the bottom of your iPhone with the right screwdriver.

3 Remove the iPhone screen

![Remove Screen](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/solution/iphone-battery-replacement/remove-iphone6-screen.jpg)

 Similar to iPhone 5 battery replacement, you need to open the iPhone screen to replace iPhone 6 battery. Place the suction cup above the iPhone "Home" button, and then you can softly pull the sucker to open a crack. Then put a plastic sheet to the crack to remove the screen bit by bit. Make the screen is perpendicular to the battery.

4 Remove the bracket and screws

![Remove Inside Screws](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/solution/iphone-battery-replacement/unscrew-iphone6-inside-screws.jpg)

 Remove the screws on the bracket and then gently remove the bracket. You'd better take iPhone screen off before you remove the bracket.

5 Eject iPhone battery

![Make iPhone 6 Battery Replacement](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/solution/iphone-battery-replacement/replace-iphone6-battery.jpg)

 iPhone 6 uses much glue to fix the battery, so it's not easy to remove it. You can directly use crowbar to take battery off. But we suggest you use hair dryer to warm the rear cover first, then you can easily remove the iPhone battery.

6 Put in the new battery

 Put the new battery back in and reconnect the cable with the opening tool. If you are worried about the glue isn't enough, you can put some double-sided tape to the battery.

Step 7 Assemble iPhone screen

 Reconnect the screen cable according the source connection. Screw the screws when you are sure that all connection is no question. Then put on the screen and screw the screws at the bottom of iPhone.

 Just follow the steps above and you can handily make iPhone 6 battery replacement all by yourself. All you need is to purchase the qualified battery and suitable tools.

### Better manage your iPhone data

 Want to directly deal with various iOS files like Android does? iTunes can't help you do that. Even you like everything about iPhone, you won't like its data manager, iTunes. Even you have used iPhone for several years, you may still feel that, iTunes is not an easy-to-use tool. Here we sincerely recommend the professional[iOS Data Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/aiseesoft/ios-transfer/) to help you manage all types of data on iPhone/iPad/iPod. You can free download it to transfer files between iOS devices and PC/Mac.

##  What to Look For in an iPhone 15 Pro Max Case in 2023

 The first thing you need to do is forget the idea of using the case for your iPhone 14 Pro Max, assuming you have one. While the new phone looks similar, it’s a different size with a different shape to the curves on the edge of the phone, so the older case won’t fit properly.

 For a new case, you need to choose which type of form factor you’re looking at, and how much grip you need. The iPhone 15 Pro Max isn’t the largest phone on the market, but as the biggest iPhone, it’s the easiest to drop, so a case with extra grip is useful. Aside from this, you can pick from anywhere on the spectrum from ultra-thin and light to larger and bulkier.

 If you’re prone to dropping your phone, or you’re often using it in environments that put it in significant danger, you’ll want to opt for a rugged case. These are bulkier but offer much more protection. If you don’t want to go this far, folio-style designs protect your screen and sometimes double as a wallet.

 Next, you’ll want to consider the material you want to use. Many cases use [thermoplastic polyurethane](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-steamvr-issues-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide/) (TPU) or plastic composite, which are relatively affordable but offer great protection. Of course, you can also choose more premium materials like leather or micro twill, which Apple uses in its own FineWoven cases.

 These materials can add to the price, so you need to decide how much you want to spend. Fortunately, this doesn’t have to affect how protected your phone is, as even budget cases can offer excellent protection. Aside from premium materials, spending more also gets you features like [MagSafe](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/mastering-regional-adjustments-how-to-update-regions-on-your-iphone/).

 Finally, don’t forget to have fun with the look. Regardless of material or price point, many cases come in various fun color options, but you can also choose a clear case to see your iPhone’s glorious finish better underneath.

##  Best iPhone 15 Pro Max Case Overall: [Spigen Mag Armor MagFit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5S86W64?th=1&tag=htg-v2-1einpjt-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000429&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-max-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![Spigen MagArmor iPhone 15 pro max case header](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/spigen-magarmor-iphone-15-pro-max-case-header.png) 

| Pros                                     | Cons                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Inexpensive, but protective              | Style isn't for everyone |
| Air Cushion technology absorbs shocks    | Limited color options    |
| Textured back makes phone easier to grip |                          |

 The iPhone 15 Pro Max is the most premium (and most expensive) smartphone from Apple, so the last thing you want to do is drop and damage it. But, you don't need to spend a lot to protect your Pro Max. The [Spigen Mag Armor MagFit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5S9BTWZ?th=1&tag=htg-v2-1einpjt-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000429&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-max-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) will offer great protection for a decent price.

 Spigen uses TPU for this case, with a chevron-style texture on the back. The design might not appeal to everyone, but it's for more than show as it'll help you grip your phone—nearly essential for such a large device. The Air Cushion technology will help absorb shocks should the Pro Max slip out of your hand.

 The Mag Armor also comes fitted with MagSafe magnets so you can use your wireless chargers and MagSafe accessories without needing to take the case off.

 If there's one major complaint about the Mag Armor MagFit, it's that there are only two color options: [Navy Blue](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5S9BTWZ?th=1&tag=htg-v2-1einpjt-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000429&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-max-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [Matte Black](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5S86W64?th=1&tag=htg-v2-1einpjt-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000429&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-max-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Since it covers your iPhone 15's finish, it would have been nice to have more colorways available.

 But if that isn't a dealbreaker, though, you can't go wrong with this case.

 Spigen has been a trusted manufacturer of cases for all manner of phones for years now, and that experience means that even the company’s more affordable case options are solid and dependable. The [Spigen Thin Fit Designed for iPhone 15 Pro Max Case](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Designed-iPhone-Military-Grade-Protection/dp/B0C5S95DVY/?tag=htg-v2-1einpjt-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000429&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-max-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offers solid protection for your phone and, as the name implies, is also quite thin.

 This case uses a hybrid design comprised of both TPU and plastic composite. The TPU absorbs shocks from falls, while the rigid plastic composite prevents anything from puncturing the case. The composite is also scratch-resistant, meaning your case won’t age prematurely, even after a few drops.

 The Spigen Thin Fit doesn’t feature magnets for MagSafe accessories, but it does feature tactile buttons and a matte finish that should help you keep your grip on the case.

 When it comes to wallet cases, there are two styles—folio-style designs that resemble a traditional wallet, and more minimalist designs that hold a few cards on the back of your phone. The [TORRO Leather Wallet Case Compatible with iPhone 15 Pro Max](https://www.amazon.com/TORRO-Leather-Case-Compatible-iPhone/dp/B0CC68VRK6?tag=htg-v2-1einpjt-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000429&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-max-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) uses the traditional design with a leather build for a touch of elegance.

 While leather is the main material you see, it’s not the only one used, as a TPE layer and elastomer prevent shock damage during falls. Meanwhile, the interior of the case has a soft microfiber lining to prevent any damage to the finish of your iPhone.

 The case isn’t paper thin, but at 0.03 inches thick, it’s far thinner than many other cases. It’s lightweight, too, weighing in at 0.63 ounces.

 Leather is a great material for phone cases because of its protective qualities, combined with the graceful aging that leather is known for. The only problem is that many cases only feature leather on the back instead of wrapping around the entire case. That isn’t an issue with the [CASETiFY Leather Case for iPhone 15 Pro Max](https://www.amazon.com/CASETiFY-Leather-Textured-Protection-Compatible/dp/B0CDQ7P64M/?tag=htg-v2-1einpjt-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000429&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-max-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 The case may look like all leather, but it also uses TPU and polycarbonate to add extra protection. You’ll also find a fiber suede inner lining, which ensures that the case doesn’t add any additional wear and tear to your iPhone’s exterior. The case features raised bezels to protect the camera and screen, plus it’s compatible with both MagSafe and wireless charging.

 While many leather cases are only available in one or two colors, the CASETiFY Leather Case for iPhone 15 Pro Max is available in four minimalist, muted color options: [Greige](https://www.amazon.com/CASETiFY-Leather-Textured-Protection-Compatible/dp/B0CDQ7P64M/?tag=htg-v2-1einpjt-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000429&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-max-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Jet Black](https://www.amazon.com/CASETiFY-Leather-Textured-Protection-Compatible/dp/B0CDQ44BJP/?tag=htg-v2-1einpjt-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000429&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-max-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Navy Blue](https://www.amazon.com/CASETiFY-Leather-Textured-Protection-Compatible/dp/B0CDQ63BY2/?tag=htg-v2-1einpjt-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000429&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-max-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [Oat Milk](https://www.amazon.com/CASETiFY-Leather-Textured-Protection-Compatible/dp/B0CDQ4NNB2/?tag=htg-v2-1einpjt-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000429&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-max-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

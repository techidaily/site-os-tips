 The Apple AirTag offers an affordable way [for iPhone users](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-two-sides-to-every-story-how-to-create-balanced-reaction-videos-on-youtube-2-pov-approach/) to track nearly anything, but there's a catch. By itself, the AirTag can really only be thrown into a bag. To make it more versatile, you'll need some accessories.

##  What to Look for When Buying an AirTag Accessory in 2024

 Unlike other [popular Bluetooth trackers](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/step-by-step-solutions-stabilizing-overwatch-2-performance-on-your-gaming-pc/), the [Apple AirTag](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX532AM-A-AirTag/dp/B0933BVK6T?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU210039&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F724536%2Fbest-apple-airtag-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) doesn't have a built-in clip or any real way to connect it to your things. Instead, you can either freely place the disk-shaped tracker inside a bag, purse, or wallet, or you can buy an accessory that allows you to attach it to your keys, suitcase, or sunglasses.

 The good news is that there are more than a handful of first and third-party accessories available for the AirTag. While Apple has primarily focused on the basics with ways to mount the [Bluetooth tracker](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/step-by-step-solutions-stabilizing-overwatch-2-performance-on-your-gaming-pc/) to your keys or bag, other companies like Moment, Nomad, and Belkin have created unique accessories that fit your every need.

 Each item in our roundup below has been expertly chosen based on our knowledge of the company manufacturing the accessory and the use case it best fits.

| Pros            | Cons                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Looks nice    | ✗ Should be included with the AirTag  |
| ✓ Durable       | ✗ Costs the same as the AirTag itself |
| ✓ Color options |                                       |

 AirTag accessories pretty much have one purpose---to allow you to attach the tracker to something. With that in mind, the best accessory for most people is the simple [AirTag Loop](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0W3ZM/A/airtag-loop).

 The AirTag Loop is lightweight and durable thanks to the polyurethane material and comes in four colors to match your style. You button the AirTag in the pouch and feed it through the slot at the end to close the loop. Simple and effective.

 It's a bit strange that the [AirTag Loop](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0W3ZM/A/airtag-loop?fnode=8b1d611fdc576f6b3e6093ad07764daa6226d3d73c24f98c2bc2e4ba1e1c7bb91980f2223b7116c08b3ccfbd188649e43a8f0bd710deebc427d15504a2e275688a3ac4a45465be154cee9bb12db8e90af1046d69a0e8a6154c51503515f0796118750ba09228c8bdd76a43616266da41) costs the same as the AirTag itself ($29), but both are affordable and make a good pair.

Best AirTag Accessory Overall

#####  Apple AirTag Loop

The Apple AirTag Loop is a simple, high-quality loop that does the job and looks good doing it.

[See at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932LZM6K?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU210039&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F724536%2Fbest-apple-airtag-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) [Target](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyplus.bn5x.net%2Fc%2F156932%2F564546%2F9358%3FsubId1%3DUUhtgUeUpU210039%26subId2%3Dehtg%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.target.com%252Fp%252Fapple%255Fairtag%255Floop%255F%255Fd%252F-%252FA-80591461) 

##  Best Budget AirTag Accessory: [Belkin Secure Holder with Strap](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093346F69?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU210039&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F724536%2Fbest-apple-airtag-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

[![Belkin AirTag holder on backpack](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Belkin-holder.jpg) Belkin](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093346F69?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU210039&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F724536%2Fbest-apple-airtag-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

| Pros                         | Cons                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ✓ Cheaper than official Loop | ✗ Not as attractive as official Loop |
| ✓ Rope is strong and durable |                                      |
| ✓ Color options              |                                      |

 The [Belkin Secure Holder with Strap](https://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F8W974) is the same concept as the [Apple Loop](https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-art-of-colors-selecting-the-creme-de-la-creme-monitors/), but a little more low-tech. Pop the AirTag into the rubber holder and use the included loop of rope to attach it to a variety of objects. Belkin has [a keyring option](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HNPR2ZM/A/belkin-secure-holder-with-key-ring?fnode=8b1d611fdc576f6b3e6093ad07764daa6226d3d73c24f98c2bc2e4ba1e1c7bb91980f2223b7116c08b3ccfbd188649e43a8f0bd710deebc427d15504a2e275688a3ac4a45465be154cee9bb12db8e90af1046d69a0e8a6154c51503515f0796118750ba09228c8bdd76a43616266da41) in case you aren't a fan of the rope.

 Belkin's holder comes in four colors and is less than half the price of the Apple Loop. It might not be quite as stylish, but the functionality is the same, and [$13 is a great price](https://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F8W974/) for it.

| ✓ High quality leather               | ✗ Keychain is a bit pricey |
| ✓ Looks very classy and premium      |                            |

| ✓ Loop is affordable                 |                            |

 If you're looking for something classy to house your AirTag, look no further than [Nomad's Leather Loop](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU210039%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-leather-loop-rustic-brown) and [Leather Keychain](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU210039%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtags-leather-keychain). They both look great without costing a dozen times more than the AirTag itself. Looking at you, [Hermès](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX872AM/A/airtag-herm%C3%A8s-key-ring).

 Nomad uses high-quality [Horween leather](https://www.horween.com/) for both the Loop and Keychain. The Loop is low-profile and attaches to the AirTag with adhesive. The Keychain is a bit larger and has a thermoformed pocket for the AirTag. Both include keyrings so you can attach the Airtag to most objects you'd need it on.

 Our sister site, Review Geek, gave the [Nomad AirTag Leather Loop a 9 out of 10 and an Editor's Choice award in its review](https://www.reviewgeek.com/89432/nomad-airtag-leather-loop-review-a-better-deal-than-apples/):

> Recommending the Nomad Leather Loop is a no-brainer. It's both cheaper and more premium than any of Apple's official cases. Although I can't use it with multiple AirTags, I love knowing that it isn't immediately obvious that I have a Bluetooth tracker attached to my keys.

 The Nomad Loop and Keychain are available in Rustic Brown and Black. The Loop starts at $25 for the brown color and $5 more for black. The Keychain is available for $40 in both color options.

 Not everything that you want to track will have a convenient way to attach an AirTag. [Moment's Fabric Mount](https://partner.shopmoment.com/c/156932/770347/11129?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU210039&subId2=ehtg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fstretch-fabric-mount-for-airtags%2Fstretch-fabric-mount-for-airtags) uses an adhesive backing so that you can stick it to nearly anything.

 The mount is made from a stretchy fabric that securely holds the [AirTag](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX532AM-A-AirTag/dp/B0933BVK6T?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU210039&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F724536%2Fbest-apple-airtag-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) like a pocket. You stick it to the item that you want to track and it's ready to go. This also makes it more discreet than some of the [other options](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-companion-for-online-radio-preservationists/) in this list.

 The Moment Fabric Mount is available in black and costs just $15\. For all those items that don't cooperate with hooks and loops, this is a nice option.

### Key Takeaways

* The Nomad Magnetic Leather Back is a phone accessory that protects the phone without adding bulk.
* The product uses magnets and micro-suction adhesive to stick to the back of a phone.
* Magnetic Leather Back is available for iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max.

 Nearly a year ago, I got a cryptic email asking if I wanted to try out a new, unreleased Nomad product. As a true earlier adopter, I agreed, even without knowing what the product was. Two days later a prototype of Nomad’s new [Magnetic Leather Back](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstreak-link.com%2FB14AaMs-vn9uK5V1kQdN46uV%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fnomadgoods.com%252Fproducts%252Fmagnetic-leather-back-rustic-brown-iphone-15-pro-max) showed up in the mail. It didn’t even have a name at the time, so I called it a MagSafe Skin in my head. These are images of the original sample from 2023.

 To most people, this thick piece of leather stuffed with a circular magnet is far from exciting—my wife told me as much. For me, however, it was a minor revolution. Previously, if you wanted ultra-minimal protection, you were limited to adhesive skins. Those are basically a wrapper, but they're hard to put on, can't be taken off, and provide no amount of protection. For the small class of people, like me, who don’t want a full case, but still want something more than using a phone case-less, the solutions were almost non-existent.

 Here are photos of the new Magnetic Leather Back in brown on a titanium iPhone 15 Pro.

 Now, in my eyes, those problems have nearly completely been eradicated with the Magnetic Leather Back. The MagSafe magnet instantly aligns on the back of an iPhone 15 Pro or 15 Pro Max and has never peeled or altered its state. It protects the back and camera without adding bulk. I don't come to these options quickly, either. I used this product for close to six months. (First on an iPhone 14 Pro and then on a 15 Pro.)

 Since the Nomad Magnetic Leather Back is ultimately a simple product, there’s no need to belabor the point. I’ve really enjoyed the ease of use of how the Magnetic Leather Back attaches and have been thoroughly impressed with how well it’s stayed in place. It also provides a tactile grip that is missing when using the iPhone 15 Pro without any case. Of course, this isn’t a phone case, so protection is limited—be warned. But I mainly want my phone guarded from dirt or messes, and this does that perfectly.

 The titanium [iPhone 15 Pro feels so nice to hold](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-direct-interaction-enhancing-live-broadcasts-with-desktop-share/) with smooth edges, and the Magnetic Leather Back allows the phone’s design to shine. My one quibble is that $40 is a lot for part of a case. But if this is the type of phone protection you’re looking for, it’s the only option. No adhesive sticker will come close.

 After receiving the early sample, one thing I did wonder about was how this product came to be. So I reached out to the company to hear more about how it brought the Magnetic Leather Back to life. Harvey Hunerberg, Nomad Sr. Product Manager, answered my questions below.

**What did the process look like for moving from a sticky adhesive skin to this MagSafe one?** 

 "Transitioning from the adhesive leather skin to a MagSafe-compatible version was driven by our core philosophy of continuous innovation and practicality. As avid iPhone enthusiasts, we recognized not just the limitation of a one-time-use adhesive skin, but also its lack of camera protection, a crucial aspect for our users.

 The evolution to a removable, MagSafe-compatible leather back was a natural step in our pursuit of offering versatile, user-friendly accessories that don't compromise on protection. Our Magnetic Leather Back not only brings the convenience of interchangeability but also ensures robust camera protection, aligning with the protective standards of traditional cases.

 This journey involved over 20 iterations in two years, reflecting our commitment to perfecting a product that seamlessly integrates with the daily lives of our users, ensuring both style and safety."

**How many iterations did it go through?** 

 "The development of the Magnetic Leather Back was an exhaustive process, involving over 20 iterations in the last two years. Because it cannot be manufactured in the same ways as a traditional case might be made, it required extensive trial and error to perfect the materials, magnetic alignment, and overall design, ensuring a product that meets our high standards of quality and functionality."

**How is that comparable to a more traditional iPhone case?** 

 "Traditional cases often follow a more predictable path, with preliminary designs largely achieved through digital tools like Photoshop and CAD. However, the Magnetic Leather Back demanded a more hands-on and rigorous approach due to its novel concept. It required an extensive number of prototypes and pre-production testing, beyond what is typical for standard cases."

**What does the design cycle for an iPhone accessory look like?** 

 "The design cycle for an iPhone accessory at Nomad is a dynamic process, aligned with the rapid pace of iPhone releases. We initiate by gathering insightful feedback on previous models from stakeholders, including customer feedback, wholesale partners, and of course our own internal team. This shapes our initial concept list and feature set, which is then translated into a detailed product feature document.

 The design journey progresses from crafting initial 2D designs to refining concepts and solidifying them into precise 3D models. Prototyping is a critical phase, where we rigorously test and iterate the design to perfection. We then engineer and prepare all necessary tools for production, ensuring each case meets our high standards. Finally, we revise our tools to optimize for mass production quality, culminating in the manufacturing of a product that meets the Nomad hallmark of quality and innovation."

**Much like iPhone is Apple’s flagship product that it can’t afford to mess up, are iPhone accessories that critical to Nomad? Do you have redundancy plans and contingencies in case something goes sideways at the wrong time?** 

 "Absolutely, at Nomad, iPhone accessories are pivotal to our product line, akin to how the iPhone is to Apple. We understand that precision in design and timing is paramount. As such, our development process is deeply rooted in risk management and strategic foresight.

 Given the nature of our industry, we often operate based on anticipated features, leading us to prepare multiple contingency designs. This proactive approach allows us to swiftly adapt to last-minute changes, as exemplified by our quick integration of MagSafe into our iPhone 12 cases and the inclusion of the Action Button in our iPhone 15 Pro cases at launch.

 Our readiness to pivot and our agile manufacturing processes ensure that we're always aligned with the latest iPhone advancements, safeguarding the relevance and excellence of our products."

**So, someone gets an idea for a new iPhone accessory; how long and how many steps does it take until it’s selling to consumers?** 

 "At Nomad, the journey from an idea to a market-ready product is a testament to our dedication to excellence and innovation. Contrary to what many might assume, there is a somewhat common practice among brands to simply rebrand pre-existing off-the-shelf designs. Nomad, however, takes a distinctly different approach.

 We meticulously design each product from the ground up, adhering to the highest standards of quality and functionality. Typically, this development cycle can span anywhere from nine months to two years. A timeline that reflects our design process, prototyping, testing, and the strategic adjustments required to address the unforeseen challenges that are part of creating top-tier iPhone accessories.

 While this approach may often extend our timeline, it ensures that every Nomad product not only meets but exceeds our standards. We design products we would proudly use ourselves, setting the bar exceptionally high for everything that bears the Nomad name."

**What is the manufacturing process like for Magnetic Leather Back?** 

 "The manufacturing process for the Magnetic Leather Back is intricate, reflecting our commitment to quality at every step. While I can't divulge the specific details of our methods, the production involves a range of precise techniques.

 It starts with CNC machining and injection molding, which form the core structure. We then cut the leather, ensuring the leather is cut to the exact dimensions required. A particularly demanding part of the process is the precision wrapping of the leather around the edges, a task that requires a high level of skill to achieve a flawless finish.

 These steps are critical in upholding the craftsmanship that each Magnetic Leather Back represents, guaranteeing that every piece not only meets our brand's high standards."

 The outdated drive will also fail to detect your SD card. For solving this, you need to do the 3 steps below:

2 Navigate "This Computer" > "Properties" > "Device Manager" > "Disk drivers".

3 Find and select your USB device, right click and first choose "Uninstall" and then choose "Scan for hardware changes" to refresh the drivers.

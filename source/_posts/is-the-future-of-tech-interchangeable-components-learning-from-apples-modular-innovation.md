 Smartphones are a core part of our daily lives, and because of that, there have been many attempts to extend their functionality. Project Ara, LG modules, Moto Mods, and the recent CMF Phone 1, to name a few. However, only Apple's MagSafe has actually spawned a successful ecosystem of adaptable accessories. Why is that?

##  The Graveyard of Failed Attempts

 The concept of a "modular" smartphone has been around for a long time. One of the first big splashes was a project called "[Phonebloks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonebloks)" in 2013\. This was supposed to be a phone with a huge range of swappable components. Everything from the camera to storage to the vibration motor could be pulled and plugged like LEGO blocks.

 Phonebloks never made it past the concept phase, but the idea carried on with Google's "[Project Ara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project%5FAra)" in that same year. Google–who was working with Motorola–had essentially the same execution as Phonebloks, but there was actually a real physical prototype and a Developer Edition. However, as was the problem with Phonebloks, the technology was just not ready, and it ended in 2016.

Google

Project Ara

 Things were quiet on the modular smartphone front for a couple of years until things heated up again in 2016\. Both LG and Motorola released flagship phones with modular aspects. First, [LG launched the G5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG%5FG5) and a meager offering of "LG Friends" peripherals. The bottom of the phone slid out and could be replaced with a camera grip or [external DAC](https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-secrets-of-crafting-an-exclusive-identifier-on-tiktok/). However, a year later, the LG G6 completely dropped the modular features.

![Moto Mods](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/moto-mods.png) 

Motorola

Moto Mods

 Motorola's idea was "Moto Mods"–hot-swappable magnetic accessories. Some of the Mods included a Hasselblad Zoom Camera lens, JBL SoundBoost speaker, battery packs, wireless charging adapters, decorative back plates, and more. Moto Mods launched with the [Moto Z in 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moto%5FZ) and continued to be supported through the Z2, Z3, and Z4\. 

 Since then, there have been some attempts from [Fairphone](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-capture-the-spectacular-with-nikon-d500-in-4k/)–who is more concerned with repairability–and HMD Global is apparently interested in the concept, too. None of these ideas have truly caught on with the general public. Motorola probably had the best effort with a system that lasted several years, but it couldn't save the company from falling into irrelevance.

##  Why MagSafe Succeeded

![MagSafe on an iPhone.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/52533931426_9c32e8d1a7_o.jpg)

Hannah Stryker / How-To Geek  
  
 Around the same time that Moto Mods faded out, Apple got into the modular accessory game with [MagSafe](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/mastering-regional-adjustments-how-to-update-regions-on-your-iphone/) on the [iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro](https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-the-soft-bricked-motorola-edgeplus-2023-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/). Like Motorola, it used magnets to attach chargers, battery packs, wallets, stands, speakers, and more. Four years later, [it remains a part of iPhone models](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/recommended-best-applications-for-mirroring-your-samsung-galaxy-a15-4g-screen-drfone-by-drfone-android/) and has generated huge demand for accessories.

 Truthfully, there's no real secret why Apple has succeeded where others have failed, but the reason shouldn't be overlooked. When Apple decides to do something–whether it's remove headphone jacks, add wireless charging, or introduce a brand new system for attaching accessories–people get on board. Why? Because people are going to buy iPhones, but more importantly, people trust Apple to stick with ideas.

 Apple Watch bands are a great example of this. The original Apple Watch was launched in 2015 with a proprietary system for attaching watch bands. Nearly a decade later, the Apple Watch Series 9 uses that exact same proprietary system. Your favorite band from the original can still work with the latest model. That's longevity.

 Other manufacturers don't have that same track record and, as a result, don't have the same trust from consumers or accessory makers. LG made a big deal about their "LG Friends" accessories, then completely ditched the idea a year later. Motorola lasted four years. That's a problem.

##  How Others Can Find Success

CMF

 The most recent entry in the modular smartphone saga is the [CMF Nothing 1](https://www.androidpolice.com/cmf-phone-1-review/). The device's back plate is easily removed with a screwdriver, and there's a big thumb screw in the bottom corner that can be taken off without tools. CMF offers a wallet, kickstand, and lanyard accessories at launch. Cool idea, but will it last?

 If CMF and others want to enjoy even a fraction of Apple's success in this realm, it boils down to a couple of points. First, a "modular" phone shouldn't _feel_ like a modular phone. MagSafe isn't a gimmick like a camera grip or a bigger speaker. Sure, it can do those things, but the user experience starts as an improvement on an existing feature: wireless charging. There's a reason for its existence beyond "Look at all this crazy stuff I can attach to my phone!"

 The second big thing is trust, as mentioned above. People know they can buy a MagSafe accessory and not worry about whether it will work with the next iPhone or not. It's like a self-sustaining ecosystem. Apple creates a new thing. People trust Apple and get excited to buy into the new thing. Manufacturers pump out products that work with the new thing. Apple sticks with the new thing because it's successful.

 The failed products mentioned earlier could never get that cycle going. When a company doesn't have that same level of trust, it creates a "wait and see" situation. Maybe people are excited, but they're nervous to buy in. If no one is willing to buy in on the ground floor, a modular accessory system is never going to get off the ground.

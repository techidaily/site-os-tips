## Additional US State Adopts iPhone's Digital ID System

The dream of carrying around your phone without other cards is still a dream in most of the United States, but slowly but surely, Apple is trying to change that. The U.S. state of Ohio now allows digital IDs to be stored on iPhones, replacing a physical driver's license or other identification.

 Ohio has become the fifth state in the U.S. to enable [digital IDs on Apple Wallet](https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-a-beginners-journey-to-selecting-the-right-action-cam/), joining Arizona, Maryland, Colorado, and Georgia. This move comes over two years after Apple initially announced plans to support digital IDs in September 2021\. Several other states have expressed interest in adopting this feature, but the rollout has been way, way slower than anticipated.

 Currently, digital IDs in Apple Wallet can be used at select US airports, including BWI, DCA, PHX, DEN, and ATL, for TSA checkpoints. Additionally, these IDs can serve as proof of age or identity at participating businesses and venues equipped with "compliant mobile ID readers." Despite the limited adoption so far, Apple remains optimistic about the future of digital IDs and aims to expand their availability nationwide. In 2021, the company indicated that it was engaged in discussions with numerous other states to bring this feature to their residents.

 It's not clear when we might see the feature roll out to more states after this, but at the rate it's going, it's certainly not going to be something nationwide, or close to nationwide, for at least a couple more years. After all, Ohio is just the fifth state that's joining this list, and we still have 45 states to go—and that's without mentioning other kinds of identifications, such as those from US territories. We're going to have to wait and see, but for now, if you're in one of those five states, carrying your wallet around just became a bit less necessary.

## Sink or Swim with Confidence: The Ultimate iPhone Protection in Apple's Premium Waterproof Case

It's estimated that 25% of smartphone users have, at some time, damaged their devices with water or some other kind of liquid. This can be a worry for iPhone and other smartphone users who love to photograph and film their participation in water-based activities.

 This is where the [ESR Waterproof Pouch](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/407B651E-21A0-457E-A9B8-598D69F4B1A4?maas=maas%5Fadg%5F1BE14B6C837718E20A839414788EA388%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas) for iPhone comes in. This protective pouch is the first to be specifically designed for iPhone and offers a tailored inner shell with exact cutouts and easy-press buttons.

 With additional features, such as the highly transparent TPU window, you’ll be able to record your underwater escapades with the precise clarity and high definition that iPhones offer.

##  Why Do I Need a Waterproof iPhone Pouch?

ESR

 When you’re out there on the water recording your snorkeling, swimming, or scuba adventures, it’s important to note that your IP68-rated iPhone is only waterproof for up to 30 minutes and to a depth of six meters. After that, it will leak water, which will cause all sorts of damage. And who needs that after shelling out a small fortune?

 The [ESR Waterproof Pouch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQNTWM5Z?maas=maas%5Fadg%5F40DFF8C3B9C1331B4A8BE2B2FD970D28%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas) for iPhone will protect your device and then some. It is particularly beneficial to scuba divers looking to record the deep. Taking an iPhone down to the depths in a waterproof pouch is much more convenient than dragging a cumbersome DSLR or mirrorless camera in underwater housing.

 And, of course, you get to go much deeper than the six meters a pouchless iPhone allows. If you own any iPhone from the 13, 14, or 15 series, you will be able to take full advantage of its capable video and camera functions with the ESR Waterproof Pouch. And, you can do this while deep underwater at up to 100 feet (30 meters).

 These cutouts are measured for the snug accommodation of their corresponding model. This precision seamlessly gives you full access to your iPhone’s camera and other features. The lens won’t be obstructed in any way, either, leaving you free to shoot the deep in all its color and glory.

 The inner shell is also a perfect fit, ensuring the [ESR Waterproof Pouch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQNSRK3P?maas=maas%5Fadg%5F37FDD4744ADEAE3CCA75A55B6953D672%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas) for iPhone gives you a considerable advantage over generic waterproof pouches. It securely holds the iPhone in place, providing reliable functionality with exact alignment.

 This alignment stretches to the easy-press buttons. They match your iPhone’s volume and power buttons, and pressing them through the pouch is a guaranteed success story every time.

 This feature allows for natural control of your iPhone. You can comfortably shoot colorful coral and record extended videos of the various marine life you encounter, ensuring mesmerizing videos and timeless memories every time.

 The thoughtful features of the[ESR Waterproof Pouch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQNTV1H4?maas=maas%5Fadg%5F4E289727FE5B6B6E282DDF0398AC545C%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas) allow for seamless submerged use of your iPhone. You can even access your apps if you’re not too deep!

###  Inflate for Submerged Touchscreen Use

 The pouch is kitted out with an inflation valve, a necessary feature for anyone using the pouch at 10 feet (three meters) or less. Inflating the pouch creates a small gap between the TPU material and the display, ensuring you can use the touchscreen when underwater.

 With the pouch inflated, you can easily snap photos, shoot videos, or even use any apps while below the surface. This enables you to log information or identify any marine animals you encounter while also offering access to navigation and safety apps.

###  Shooting Down in the Deep

 Any deeper than 10 feet and the touchscreen can no longer be used. But don’t fret! You can still operate the camera by accessing the physical buttons on your iPhone via the pouch’s easy-press buttons feature.

 Before going deeper than 10 feet, ensure your iPhone is in the mode you desire (photo or video). You can then use the volume button to snap a shot or start and stop a video recording.

 With the perfect fit of the [ESR Waterproof Pouch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQNVP58S?maas=maas%5Fadg%5F28FE1E02F1A72FA2A69CA60E82C91C65%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas) for iPhone, there is never any obstruction covering the transparent TPU lens window. What’s more, the premium, highly transparent TPU material has a 92% light-transmittance rating. This delivers minimal distortion and exceptional clarity to your photos and videos for natural, awe-inspiring images of the deep.

 The ESR Waterproof Pouch for iPhone also features a built-in buoyant sponge airbag. This addition is a vital feature of the pouch as it prevents your precious iPhone from accidentally sinking into the depths.

 Your device will stay afloat and will always be within reach with the additional security of the included adjustable lanyard. You can even purposefully let the iPhone go in the knowledge that it's tethered status means it isn't going very far.

 The sponge airbag and lanyard make this pouch a superb choice for other watersports, too, such as swimming, snorkeling, kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding, or even just dipping your toes in at the shore.

##  Setting Up and Using the Pouch

###  Inserting the iPhone

 Inserting your iPhone securely into the pouch is simple. Just open the locking hatch and pull out the inner tray. Place the iPhone on the tray and slide it back inside.

 Jam the closing latch shut, and you’re ready to dive in. The latch is stiff and robust, and your iPhone is perfectly safe inside.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

###  Inflating the Pouch

 If you’re not going too deep, you’ll need to inflate the pouch for touchscreen access. This process is also easy. Simply insert the included inflation nozzle into the valve. Next, blow into the nozzle until there is a gap between the screen and pouch, then close the rubber seal. Done.

 Once you hit the water, the pressure will deflate the pouch slightly and give you full access to the touchscreen.

##  Customer Support and Warranty

 ESR offers comprehensive customer support as well as access to setup videos and FAQs should you need them. And, with a 12-month warranty and lifetime support, you can be sure you are getting a reliable product with outstanding bang for your buck.

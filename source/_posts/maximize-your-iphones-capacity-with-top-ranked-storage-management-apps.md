 Usually, you can clear the cache by opening the app, but this takes a lot of time if you have many applications and the tablet is already slow in performance. The good thing is you can individually clear the app cache on the settings, which saves more time. Here’s what you need to do:

Step 1:

 Open Settings on the iPad and navigate to theGeneral menu.

Step 2:

 Choose theiPad Storage option and wait until the page is completely loaded. It depends on the device's stored data so it might take a while.

## Part 3\. Tips: What Happens if I Clear Cache on iPad

 In reality, cache helps to find your interests when surfing the internet or using an app. But it can pile up, and the cache can be an issue for the device. When you observe your iPad acting up, clearing the cache is a recommended method to regulate the speed. But what really happens when deleting them from browsers and applications?

 A good choice of erasing the cache will bring your iPad to a tip-top shape. But this is what happens to an app you cleared: some settings will be deleted, but it will not sign you out from accounts and other credentials. For the browsers, it will remove your search histories, while for the apps, temporary files will be deleted. Don’t worry; these files can be obtained again as you continue to use the apps. Doing cache removal regularly is not only good for tech hygiene but also frees up more storage space.

 However, you have to learn that the information deleted will cause a few lags when you use the app or visit a website, and this is because it will need to load the data again. Also note that clearing cache, history, and cookies should not be done so often because it will lose the purpose of loading improvements. Do it when the device is slower or acting up.

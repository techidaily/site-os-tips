## Simple Transfer: How to Move Your Google Images Seamlessly Into the Cloud on iCloud

You can now transfer Google Photos content to your iCloud account through an official tool developed by Google. If you're paying for a Google One subscription just to keep an old Google Photos account on life support, now's the time to consolidate everything into iCloud.

 The transfer tool, called [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/takeout/transfer/custom/photos), is tucked within the "Data & privacy" section of your Google account settings. It's incredibly easy to use—log into the Google account that's associated with your Google Photos setup, open Google Takeout, select "iCloud Photos" as your transfer destination, and sign in with your Apple ID. Transferring through Google Takeout may take a few hours (or days), but it occurs automatically after the transfer process has been triggered.

 A similar tool that transfers [iCloud contents to Google Photos](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-praise-in-pixels-the-new-marketing-trend/) was launched in 2021\. I'm not sure why it took three years to develop the new Google Photos to iCloud transfer tool, but hey, better late than never.

 Transferred photos and videos _are not_ deleted from your iCloud or Google Photos account. Both services will retain the metadata of transferred files (location data, timestamps, etc) and attempt to sort photos into any albums that you previously created, though some albums may not be carried over during the transfer.

 If you're transferring to Google Photos, be sure that your account has enough storage to accommodate all of the pictures and videos that you're moving over. Otherwise, you may end up with duplicate files when the transfer is resumed. (Documentation from Apple and Google differs on this point—Apple says duplicates won't happen, Google says the opposite. I suggest playing it safe.)

 Note that the available storage on your phone or computer has no impact on photo or video transfer. iCloud and Google Photos communicate with each other through the cloud during this process.

 Additional information, including supported file types, can be found in [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213483) or [Google's](https://support.google.com/photos/answer/10502587?hl=en) file transfer instructions.

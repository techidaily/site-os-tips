 When it comes to protecting your iPad, the [Shift Magnetic Case from ESR](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRHKL3Q1?maas=maas%5Fadg%5F65406D5B19AD7D3835CF82210C232E88%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas) is a great option to keep your tablet safe while also seamlessly expanding on how you use it.

 The case has all the features you’d expect from a high-end iPad case, including full Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Pencil (USB-C) support, auto sleep and wake-up functions, a camera guard, and designated cutouts for all of your iPad’s ports.

 What separates ESR’s Shift Magnetic Case from the pack is the way that it effortlessly transforms into a stand to fit your exact needs. There are nine different stand angles to choose from, with six being intended for viewing and three for writing.

 The notches for the stand are built into the case and magnetically reinforced to ensure that nothing slips or wobbles as you use your iPad. These magnets are also designed to allow you to adjust your viewing even further.

 Similarly, the Shift Magnetic Case features a back case for the iPad proper. This allows you to quickly and easily snap your iPad to the top of the case in order to raise it over eight centimeters for a more natural viewing angle. Alternatively, you can use this to rotate your iPad for a portrait use mode, for when you want to use Facetime or simply browse the internet.

 This back case also allows you to easily remove the iPad from the case for a lighter experience and return it as needed. You can even use it to place your iPad on a fridge or other metal surface, if you so wish.

 You can get ESR’s Shift Magnetic Case for the [iPad Pro 13](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRHKL3Q1?maas=maas%5Fadg%5F65406D5B19AD7D3835CF82210C232E88%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas), [iPad Pro 11](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRHJ1QGJ?maas=maas%5Fadg%5F43795F4D1B1C3D9BFAEC7AD95514264A%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas), [iPad Air 13](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRHHW9HR?maas=maas%5Fadg%5F05D1A2E4A4AB508448D68E65978D466B%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas), and [iPad Air 11](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CF1RJG14?maas=maas%5Fadg%5F3BC1894327A3E0B625D42F7183C8ACB2%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas).

 For an iPad case that not only protects your device but also increases your productivity, the [Rebound Magnetic Keyboard Case 360](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CTGXN585?maas=maas%5Fadg%5FDFF8BE12D98F1152082D639E400A4778%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas) is an excellent option.

 It has all the features you might expect, such as full pencil 2 support, automatic sleeping and waking functions, and a magnetic latch, though that’s not what makes the case special.

 ESR’s Rebound Magnetic Keyboard Case 360 features the same magnetic back case as the Shift Magnetic Case, but attaches to an adjustable top stand, keyboard, and trackpad.

 The stand allows you to easily adjust your screen for a viewing angle that is perfect for your needs, while allowing you to seamlessly switch between portrait and landscape modes as needed.

 The keyboard uses Bluetooth to connect to the iPad itself, and not only delivers a smooth typing experience, but also backlit keys with seven different color options and three brightness levels so that you can work anywhere.

 The trackpad comes with full multitouch gesture support, meaning that you can use it as easily as you do a laptop. You can tap, pinch, swipe, and more, meaning that you have absolute control over your navigation experience with the Rebound Magnetic Keyboard Case 360.

 ESR’s Magnetic Keyboard Case 360 is available for the [iPad Air 13](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CTGXN585?maas=maas%5Fadg%5FDFF8BE12D98F1152082D639E400A4778%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas), [iPad Pro 11](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CTBLDBF7?maas=maas%5Fadg%5F3A3815EF925D36D27D1CD240074828AF%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas), [iPad Air 11](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C246MHXK?maas=maas%5Fadg%5FC46B044DBA3C6AB8B2F6FB553CCC962C%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas&th=1), and [iPad Pro 13](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CTGWZ3DL?maas=maas%5Fadg%5F0287A0DE7B6F48318347A7336E5F9437%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas).

###  ESR Paper-Feel Magnetic Screen Protector

![esr paper-feel magnetic screen protector shown peeling off ipad](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/esr-paper-feel-magnetic-screen-protector.jpg) 

ESR

 If you frequently use your iPad as a canvas or notebook, then you understand that the feel of a stylus on a screen has a very different feel from a pencil on paper. ESR has found a way to remedy this with its [Paper-Feel Magnetic Screen Protector](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSYK48JS?maas=maas%5Fadg%5FE0D16E9D2F2FA6B3AEDC7DE596FCD2CB%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas).

 This screen protector not only serves as a way to keep your screen safe, but also as a way to change the way that it feels to use your iPad. The screen protector is precisely textured so as to create just enough extra friction to feel like real paper. This makes drawing and writing easier by giving you extra control over your movements.

 The best part of ESR’s Paper-Feel Magnetic Screen Protector isn’t that it can seamlessly emulate the texture of paper for your iPad, but that it’s magnetic. The edges of the screen protector connect perfectly with your tablet, making application simple and removing common pain points such as bubbles beneath the screen.

 This means that you can place the Paper-Feel Magnetic Screen Protector down when you want to write or draw, and then remove it when you want an experience like a regular tablet, say for browsing the internet or using FaceTime.

 The Paper-Feel Magnetic Screen Protector by ESR is available for the [iPad Pro 13](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSYK48JS?maas=maas%5Fadg%5FE0D16E9D2F2FA6B3AEDC7DE596FCD2CB%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas), [iPad Pro 11](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSYPN2P9?maas=maas%5Fadg%5F9C589AB2E4251EABD705A8B7C030C994%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas), iPad Air 13, and iPad Air 11.

 The Paper-Feel Magnetic Screen Protector is a great first step for upping your drawing and writing process on the iPad, but can be taken even further by combining it with [ESR’s Digital Pencil Pro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C3B252C9?maas=maas%5Fadg%5FE293C8341D5806FB5F9DD78908480908%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas).

 This premium iPad stylus features an extremely high-quality 1.5-mm nib that is extremely precise, making it perfect for better conductivity and precision that you would have otherwise thought possible.

 The Digital Pencil Pro features a standard USB-C charging mode, or a more convenient wireless place-and-go magnetic charging mode. Combine this with the fact that ESR’s Digital Pencil Pro doesn’t need to be paired, and you have yourself a premium iPad stylus that will take you to the next level.

 You can pick up the Digital Pencil Pro in three different colors [off of Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C3B252C9?maas=maas%5Fadg%5FE293C8341D5806FB5F9DD78908480908%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas&th=1).

 This screen protector is designed to be ultra-tough. It is capable of withstanding impacts of up to 110 lb., making it ten times stronger than the industry standard. This is all thanks to the triple-strengthening process that ESR puts the screen protector through.

This ultra-hardness has also been shown to pass a 10,000-time scratch tested and a four-foot ball drop test without problems. All in all, it’s fair to say that this screen protector is as tough as it gets.

 On top of this, ESR’s Armorite Screen Protector is incredibly easy to apply thanks to its easy-application tray. This tray takes the guesswork out of application and allows you to simply align the screen protector exactly where it needs to be. It also allows you to effortlessly remove any bubbles, resulting in a perfect application every time.

 ESR’s Armorite Screen Protector is available for the [iPad Pro 13](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSYWB44T?maas=maas%5Fadg%5F35FF75E56B2C7181CFD5F8B4B1F0B52A%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas), [iPad Pro 11](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSYNYNSN?maas=maas%5Fadg%5FF5650886FFBDCCEACE4E978871B2C792%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas), iPad Air 13, and iPad Air 11.

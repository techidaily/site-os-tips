 The iPhone's Always On Display keeps the clock and iOS lock screen visible at all times. If you don't want that, disabling the feature requires only a quick trip to the settings menu.

##  Turn off Always-On Display on Your iPhone

 To turn off the Always On Display (AOD), start by [opening Settings on your iPhone](https://printer-issues.techidaily.com/fixed-hp-printer-no-output-issue/) and tapping "Display & Brightness."

![Select "Display & Brightness" in your iPhone's settings menu.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone-display-and-brightness.png) 

 Scroll through the settings until you see the toggle for "Always On" then tap it to turn it off.

 You're done—your iPhone can rest its weary display. 

##  You Can Customize the Always On Display on Your iPhone

 If you want to customize the Always On Display feature to show one or both of your notifications and wallpaper, here’s how.

 Head to Settings > Always On Display once more and toggle on or off any of the customization options.

 With Show Notifications toggled off, you can focus on just the time and your widgets. Toggle Wallpaper off instead to see a black background for a minimal look.

##  Which iPhones Support Always On Display?

 Sadly, the Always On Display is not available for all iPhones. As of June 2024, you can only enable Always On Display if you use an iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 15 Pro, or iPhone 15 Pro Max.

 With the AOD enabled, your lock screen will remain on and visible even after you lock your phone. You may find this feature useful if you want to keep an eye on the time or your notifications without unlocking your phone.

 The AOD is also adaptive. If you leave the Always On Display setting enabled and then place your iPhone face down, it will automatically turn off. The same goes for keeping your iPhone in your bag or pocket, or when turning on Low Power Mode.

##  Does the Always On Display Really Drain Your iPhone Battery?

 Apple [says](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213435) the [power drain of an Always On Display](https://win-forum.techidaily.com/guide-step-by-step-process-to-refresh-your-windows-10-driver-software/) is minimal thanks to [screen dimming](https://solve-manuals.techidaily.com/abbyy-secures-soc-2-type-2-accreditation-for-enhanced-data-security/) and a lower refresh rate, but sometimes every drop of juice counts.

 Don't forget there are plenty more ways you can [extend the life of your iPhone's battery](https://app-tips.techidaily.com/revive-your-ipad-top-3-strategies-to-restore-connectivity-with-itunes/).

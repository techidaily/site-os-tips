 If you ask me, as far as phone developments go, [wireless charging](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fake-snapchat-location-without-jailbreak-on-vivo-y02t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) is one of the greatest things that has ever happened in the phone world. In fact, I hardly ever plug my phone in anymore and haven't for years.

 I don't always plug my phone in, but when I do it's into a powerful fast charger. Wireless charging might be the best since sliced bread, but when you need to go from 5% battery life to 55% battery life in a hurry, you need a fast charger. Whether you're shopping for [a wall charger](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/freedom-in-viewing-is-vlc-more-powerful-than-mpc-for-2024/) or a [car charger](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-milliseconds-and-megabits-deconstructing-20mb-videos/), there are many great options.

##  MagSafe Accessories: Magnets, How Do They Work?

![A MagSafe phone mount in a car.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/iPhoneGifts1.jpg) 

Belkin

[MagSafe](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/mastering-regional-adjustments-how-to-update-regions-on-your-iphone/) is a magnet-based tech from Apple that brought its popular magnetic charging design the MacBook to the iPhone. You can find it in everything from snap-on wallets to clip-free [car mounts](https://howto.techidaily.com/7-fixes-for-unfortunately-phone-has-stopped-on-itel-p55-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/).

Related: [What Is MagSafe for iPhone, and What Can It Do?](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/mastering-regional-adjustments-how-to-update-regions-on-your-iphone/) 

 Do note that unlike the other gifts in this roundup, compatibility depends on the iPhone model. MagSafe accessories only work with iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro models.

 But if they have a compatible phone it makes for a pretty great gift because either your giftee is already using it (and more MagSafe gear is welcome) or they're unfamiliar with MagSafe (and will be blown away by how cool it is).

#####  Anker MagSafe Charging Puck

If your friend hasn't started using MagSafe yet, you can't go wrong getting them a basic MagSafe compatible charger to introduce them to wireless magnetic click-and-go charging.

#####  Apple MagSafe Wallet for iPhone

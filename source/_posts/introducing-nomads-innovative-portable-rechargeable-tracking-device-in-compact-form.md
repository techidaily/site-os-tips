## Introducing Nomad's Innovative Portable Rechargeable Tracking Device in Compact Form

Wallet trackers like the Chipolo CARD tend to use a disposable design—they don't have replaceable or rechargeable batteries. Now, Nomad is entering the Bluetooth tracker market with its Tracking Card, a device that connects to Apple's Find My network and offers wireless charging over Qi or MagSafe.

 At just 2mm thick, the [Nomad Tracking Card](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2003275%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Ftracking-card) is about the size of two credit cards. It fits into your wallet and provides tracking through the Apple Find My network. Nomad also achieved an IPX7 waterproof design, meaning that the Tracking Card will endure a dip in the pool or a night in a rainstorm.

 Of course, the Nomad Tracking Card's most notable feature is its rechargeable battery. Wallet-sized Bluetooth trackers, such as the [Tile Slim](https://www.tile.com/product/black-slim) or [Chipolo CARD Point](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-taking-your-videos-to-the-next-level-expert-pc-methods-for-youtubers/), rarely offer the user-replaceable batteries that we see in [Apple's AirTags](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/medical-and-health-facebook-ads-campaign-tips/) and other, larger trackers. In a form factor where replaceable batteries aren't much of an option, rechargeable batteries make sense.

 Nomad says that you'll need to charge the Tracking Card every five months. That's not too bad, but it certainly isn't amazing. The Apple AirTag can last a year on a charge, while the disposable Chipolo CARD One promises two years of use. So, you don't need to throw the Nomad Tracking Card away when the battery dies, but you'll need to slap it on a wireless charger at least twice a year—a reasonable compromise. (Your phone may also [reverse wireless charging](https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-for-people-wanting-to-mock-gps-on-samsung-galaxy-s23-tactical-edition-devices-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/), meaning that it can act as a wireless charger. Food for thought.)

 Note that while the Tracking Card is MagSafe compatible, it doesn't contain a magnetic array and will not demagnetize any credit cards. The Tracking Card simply contains enough metal to connect to a MagSafe charger. However, I'm not sure how well the Tracking Card's charging element will line up with the average MagSafe charging pad.

 The [Nomad Tracking Card](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2003275%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Ftracking-card) is available today for $40\. It's compatible with Apple's Find My network but does not support Google Find My Device. If you already own an AirTag and don't want to buy another tracker, consider buying Nomad's [Card for AirTag](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2003275%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fcard-for-airtag) instead.

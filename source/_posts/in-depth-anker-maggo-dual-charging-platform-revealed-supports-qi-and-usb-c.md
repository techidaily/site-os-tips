## In-Depth Anker MagGo Dual Charging Platform Revealed: Supports Qi & USB-C

### Key Takeaways

* The Anker MagGo Magnetic Charging Station is a compact power hub with multiple ports, but its design may not be convenient for accessing all the connections.
* The layout of ports on the back of the charging station is not ideal, making it difficult to access the USB ports while the AC outlets are in use.
* The MagGo charger works well for charging iPhones and other phones with Qi2 magnetic plates, but it functions similarly to a MagSafe charger and may not be necessary for Android users.

 At a little bigger than the size of a HomePod mini, the [Anker MagGo Magnetic Charging Station (8-in-1)](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Charging-Certified-Ultra-Fast/dp/B0C9SXT9TC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001618&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fanker-maggo-magnetic-charging-station-8-in-1-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is a compact way to add lots of power ports to your desk. It’s a neat form factor for a power hub, but it’s not necessarily convenient to access all the connections.

##  A Ball of Wonder That Is Meant For a Desk

![Anker MagGo Charging Station Ports](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/anker-maggo-charging-station-ports.jpg)

 The sphere shape of the 8-in-1 charging station is fun at first glance, but depending on your desk layout, it might not make the most sense. The front contains a Qi2 magnetic phone charger. And I know it’s the front because it would be weird to have your phone pointed away from you.

 On the back are three AC outlets, two USB-C ports, and two USB-A ports. I would have preferred one few A ports and one more C port, but it’s still a good mix of power plugs.

 I was able to replace an [Anker 727 Charging Station](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charging-GaNPrime-Detachable-Extension/dp/B09SG31NPT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001618&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fanker-maggo-magnetic-charging-station-8-in-1-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), which my Studio Display and standing desk plugged into, as well as a MagSafe stand, with this new charging station.

 The AC power cords were stiffer, as they tend to be, so the Anker ball didn’t always orient the way I wanted it to on my desk. I have my desk up against a wall, so all the cords sticking off the MagGo charger aren’t seen. However, if your desk is more open, it will appear messy and distract from its compact shape.

 One tiny detail I liked a lot was the 45-degree flat plug that connects the charging station to the wall.

##  The Plug Layout Is Odd

![Anker MagGo Charging Station with Rear Cables plugged in](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/anker-maggo-rear-cables.jpg) 

Sergio Rodriguez / How-To Geek

 With all the ports in the back, I found the layout of those to be a bit odd. For example, with two or three of the AC outlets being used, it was quite hard to get to the four USB ports. They're not easily accessible enough to use blindly. I always needed to stand up and peek around the back to get a cable plugged in. I wish the layout had been switched so the AC outlets were beneath the USB ports.

 With eight different connections, there are a lot of combinations for how much power each port delivers. The highlight of an involved [Anker description](https://www.anker.com/products/a91c5-maggo-qi2-magnetic-charging-station-magsafe-compatible?variant=43008146473110) (under the specification section at the bottom of the page) is that one USB-C can provide 67W of power. If more devices are plugged into the other USB ports or magnetic charger, that number goes down. With every port and spot occupied, that USB-C power will go down to 20W.

##  Qi2 Works Well, But the Same as MagSafe

![iPhone docked on the Anker MagGo charging station](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/iphone-dock-anker-maggo.jpg) 

Sergio Rodriguez / How-To Geek

 While the front magnetic Qi2 charger will charge an iPhone at its full 15W speed, it’s not technically MagSafe. That also means that any Android phone with a Qi2 magnetic plate on the back could stick to this charger, too. Right now, there aren’t really any others, so it’s still essentially made for iPhone.

 In fact, it wasn’t any different from using a MagSafe charger, so there’s not much to add about its functionality. The angle of the magnetic charger is a little more tilted back than I was used to, but I found it to be fine for viewing.

 My iPhone 15 Pro was able to charge in portrait or landscape, so [StandBy mode](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/24-illuminate-your-videos-with-17-lighting-hacks/) worked just fine. Although the design of the MagGo Charging Station seems ideal for a nightstand, its three AC outlets really seem to be overkill for that area of the home.

##  Price and Availability

 The Anker MagGo Magnetic Charging Station (8-in-1) is available now and comes in black or white. It retails for $99.99\. This model replaces the previous 637 with the same shape and connection types. The difference is that the new model uses Qi2 and has a top output power of 67W instead of 65W.

##  Should You Buy the Anker MagGo Magnetic Charging Station (8-in-1)?

![Angled Anker MagGo Charging Station on a desk](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/angled-magsafe-charger-anker-maggo.jpg)

 If you’re looking for a reverse mullet charging station—business in the back, of course—then look no further than the [Anker MagGo Magnetic Charging Station (8-in-1)](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Charging-Certified-Ultra-Fast/dp/B0C9SXT9TC?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001618&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fanker-maggo-magnetic-charging-station-8-in-1-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate). The power hub is compact enough to sit nearly anywhere, while still having eight charging areas. It’s a worthwhile consideration.

 Even though the cords and wires coming off of its backside may not be the prettiest sight, it still functions well. The features make it a solid value. Its look will really come down to individual desk layouts and the location where it's being used.

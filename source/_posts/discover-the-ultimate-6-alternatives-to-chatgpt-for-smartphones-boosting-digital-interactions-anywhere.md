 The ChatGPT mobile app is arguably one of the most popular AI chatbots on the market, but there are a bunch of alternatives you can try that offer an array of unique features to improve and customize your chatbot experience.

## [Nova](https://novaapp.ai/): For the Best Prompt Suggestions

 Let's dive right in with Nova ([Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001447/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scaleup.chatai&pli=1) or [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ai-chatbot-nova/id1669007652)), a user-friendly AI chatbot powered by ChatGPT and GPT-4\. The cool thing about Nova is that it's easier than [learning to use ChatGPT](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-why-your-whatsapp-location-is-not-updating-and-how-to-fix-on-samsung-galaxy-m14-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) because you don't need to be a pro at crafting prompts. It offers handy built-in suggestions to kickstart your queries, making it easy to use, and perfect for AI newbies. Nova also offers OCR (Optical Character Recognition), so you can take a picture of a question and the app will scan your text and provide you with an answer.

 Nova keeps you connected across all your devices and is available on Mac, iPhone, Android, web, and even Apple Watch, ensuring your chat history is always at hand. This also makes it a perfect ChatGPT alternative if you're into the Apple ecosystem and is what makes it my personal favorite on this list.

 While Nova is free to use, the free version is pretty basic. You get only three messages a day, answers have a 500-character limit, you have a maximum of 10 chats in your history, and you may also have to view ads. So, if you're looking for the best experience, you'll need to upgrade to the Pro version, which costs $4.99/week.

## [Chatsonic](https://writesonic.com/chatgpt-app-chatsonic): For Content Creation

 Writesonic's Chatsonic ([Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001447/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.writesonic.chatsonic)), powered by GPT-4, boasts a comprehensive suite of features, including image generation, making it the perfect ChatGPT alternative for content creators. Like Nova, Chatsonic simplifies the creative process by providing some basic prompts to help you get started. But Chatsonic takes it a step further and lets you decide your chatbot's personality. This way, you can transform your chatbot from a general AI to a more specialized bot to fit your needs, whether as a travel guide, stand-up comedian, or even an accountant.

 One of its standout features is its ability to fetch the latest data from Google, ensuring your queries are met with the most current information, complete with sources. It also has a memory feature that allows it to remember your previous questions for follow-up messages. Although, this feature costs you two credits per use.

 Notably, Chatsonic includes web search and image generation features for free, which are typically behind a paywall for ChatGPT users. This makes Chatsonic not just a powerful tool but also a cost-effective one for those looking to maximize their AI experience. The base version of Chatsonic is free, but you are only afforded 1,000 words; those needing more can opt for one of the paid plans. The Starter plan is priced at $9.99/month for 40,000 words, while the Pro plan offers a more substantial 250,000 words for $49.99/month.

 Finally, Chatsonic is currently available only on Android devices, but Writesonic says an iOS version is in the works.

## [Elephas](https://elephas.app/): For Business or Individual Correspondence

![Elephas' welcome page.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/elephas-welcome-page.jpg) 

![Elephas' chatbot.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/elephas-chatbot.jpg)

 Elephas ([iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/elephas-ai-writing-assistant/id6444680023)) is the go-to AI chatbot for productivity, whether it's for personal use or steering a business. As an AI chatbot, it excels in handling tasks like swiftly replying to emails, polishing social media posts, and spotting grammatical errors. To get started with Elephas, you'll need an OpenAI key. This gives you maximum flexibility and means you can utilize the full capabilities of GPT-3\. To [get an OpenAI key](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-iphone-xs-without-passcode-by-drfone-ios-unlock-ios-unlock/) simply visit the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/), create an account, and generate your key.

 One of Elephas's standout features is its integrated keyboard, designed to enrich your messaging experience without the need to switch apps. You can conveniently access Elephas directly from your keyboard, whether you're on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. And for those [concerned about ChatGPT's privacy](https://program-issues.techidaily.com/inside-scoop-fixing-your-issue-with-minecraft-connection-to-world-unable/), Elephas is a great choice because it neither stores nor analyzes your text content.

 Additionally, Elephas is a bit of a polyglot, with most features working with a variety of languages, including Spanish and French. The best part is that all this utility comes at a pretty sweet price. Elephas costs just $4/month with a 30-day free trial, and the average user will pay $1 to OpenAI for its services, bringing the monthly cost to about $5/month. This plan is cheaper than GPT Plus and makes Elephas one of the more affordable AI chatbots on this list.

 Microsoft's Bing Chat ([Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001447/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.bing&hl=en&gl=US) or [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bing-chat-with-ai-gpt-4/id345323231)), also known as Copilot, has swiftly emerged as a formidable contender in the realm of conversational AI, bringing stiff competition to ChatGPT since its market debut. While Bing has been Microsoft's search engine since 2009, it's the recent integration of AI that has truly transformed the Bing mobile app. Now, it boasts an AI chatbot capable of scouring the web for the most up-to-date information tailored to your needs.

 Beyond simple searches, [Copilot is easy to use](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-gmail-password-on-vivo-y100-5g-devices-by-drfone-android/) and lets you generate images with AI, setting it a step ahead of ChatGPT, which only recently introduced web browsing capabilities and is only available for those on ChatGPT Plus. If staying updated with the latest news or [generating images through simple prompts](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/2024-approved-social-networking-101-registering-with-facebook/) is what you seek, Copilot stands ready to assist, all without any cost. But while the service is free, you'll need to sign in to access the full breadth of features, like more questions and longer conversations.

 Jasper ([iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jasper-ai-copilot/id6467556514)) stands out as a stellar ChatGPT alternative, tailored specifically for marketing professionals and businesses. It's not just another AI tool; Jasper is fine-tuned for marketing effectiveness, offering a broad array of prompts dedicated to tasks like crafting compelling copy and optimizing for search engines. What sets it apart from ChatGPT is its focus on business-centric marketing strategies, ensuring your content aligns with your enterprise goals.

 A notable feature of Jasper is its customizable prompts. You can adjust metrics such as tone, style, and even the language of your text, making it an invaluable asset for content marketing specialists. Jasper's prompt library allows you to save and create your own prompts, enhancing your efficiency and creativity.

 While the basic functionalities cater to most needs, the pro version of Jasper elevates your content creation with higher word limits for both input and output. Priced at $39/month, it's an investment in quality and precision, but compared with [ChatGPT's subscription plan, ChatGPT Plus](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/intel-core-i7-258-v-vs-amd-ryzen-phoenix-a-battle-for-the-top-spot-on-bapco-benchmarks/), which costs $20/month, it's almost twice the cost. Jasper is available on iOS and can also be accessed via the web.

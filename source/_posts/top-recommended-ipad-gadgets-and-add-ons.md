##  How Accessories Can Transform Your iPad

 The best iPad accessories help extend your iPad's capabilities, provide an added layer of screen protection, or just make the iPad easier to use overall.

 Today, there's no shortage of first and third-party cases, keyboards, stylus, and more for your iPad. The best of these accessories help extend your iPad's capabilities and make it more useful. For example, magnetic keyboards and a stylus can convert your iPad into a sketchbook or [laptop](https://win-dash.techidaily.com/1722972482843-corsair-void-pro-windows-driver-download-and-installation-made-simple/) for more intensive writing or graphic design projects.

 In determining what to look for in an iPad accessory, consider what you want out of your tablet. Are you an avid note-taker who prefers writing to typing? If so, a stylus may be in the cards. Dislike the iPad's on-screen keyboard? A separate keyboard with various viewing angle adjustments and backlit keys may be what you need to work comfortably.

 Regardless of the use, we are big fans of iPad accessories that help users save time, work more comfortably, and ultimately become more productive.

 Apart from the features specific to each accessory, you'll also want a product from a company with a solid and trouble-free track record. Let's not forget about excellent usability and function, either! An accessory can't be good if it's not useful.

 So, keep reading to learn more about our picks for the best Apple iPad accessories.

The second-generation Apple Pencil is much improved over its predecessor with improved latency and a new flatter side that makes the stylus easier to hold.

 The Apple Pencil 2's feel is virtually flawless as well. A powerful combination of the [iPad Pro](https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B09328WZPR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208533&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F757335%2Fbest-ipad-accessory%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)'s 120Hz refresh rate, built-in pressure function, and a matte-feel tip makes the stylus feel great against the iPad's screen.

 One of our favorite features of the Apple Pencil 2 is its [charging method](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/in-2024-acquire-high-quality-sounds-for-media-creators/). The stylus uses a magnetic mount on top of your iPad to sync and charge. By intuitively storing your Apple Pencil 2 on top of your iPad, you can expect your battery never to fall to zero.

 Although pricy, the Apple Pencil 2 is head over heels above the competition of copycats out there and is equally useful for [note-takers](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/updated-3-straightforward-methods-to-fine-tune-shades/) and graphic/design artists.

 Note, however, that the Apple Pencil 2 is incompatible with the [iPad 9th generation](https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-Cellular/dp/B09G9GLLRN?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208533&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F757335%2Fbest-ipad-accessory%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or [iPad 10th generation](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLT98Q7?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208533&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F757335%2Fbest-ipad-accessory%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) models. You will need to purchase the [Apple Pencil 1](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MK0C2AM-A-Apple-Pencil/dp/B016NY7784?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208533&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F757335%2Fbest-ipad-accessory%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) if you need a stylus for those models or pick up an [Apple Pencil alternative](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/how-to-create-a-digital-signature-online-for-fodt-file-document-by-ldigisigner-sign-a-word-sign-a-word/).

| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ✓ 4-year battery life                          | ✗ Keys may pop off with heavy use  |
| ✓ Perfectly-spaced keys                        | ✗ Keyboard not removable from case |
| ✓ Rugged construction and thick rubber bumpers |                                    |

 The [Logitech iPad Keyboard Case](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YFFKH27?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208533&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F757335%2Fbest-ipad-accessory%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a versatile accessory. Long considered a cheaper alternative to [Apple's Magic Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0931V9M9D?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208533&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F757335%2Fbest-ipad-accessory%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), this case converts your iPad into a laptop with a design that works as a keyboard and case cover.

 A magnetic latch keeps your folio closed, and protection is pretty good with rugged construction and thick rubber bumpers designed for impact. In terms of tactile feedback, the Logitech iPad Keyboard is very responsive. The keys are perfectly spaced out, and each carries a slightly rubbery feel for comfort. Built-in backlighting also helps tremendously in locating keys in the dark.

 The Logitech case has an impressive 4-year battery life using two replaceable coin cell batteries. It also lasts up to 3 months per charge with several power-saving features, including automatic shut off when not docked in typing mode.

 If you want cheaper and beefier protection than Apple's [Smart Keyboard Folio](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smart-Keyboard-11-inch-iPad-Pro/dp/B08635GZ8H?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208533&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F757335%2Fbest-ipad-accessory%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) for your iPad, this keyboard case is a fine choice.

 Any of Apple's AirPods make for a great companion to your iPad, whether you're listening to music or watching a YouTube video. That said, if you're looking for something to block out the world and let you focus on your music or video, the [second-generation AirPods Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Personalized-Customizable/dp/B0BDHWDR12?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208533&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F757335%2Fbest-ipad-accessory%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) are a perfect choice.

 Why? Our [review of the Apple Airpods Pro](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-show-wi-fi-password-on-vivo-v27-pro-by-drfone-android/) sound give you a good idea:

 The new AirPods Pro sound better than the originals, and noise cancellation has seen a massive upgrade. They're easier to charge, easier to use, and if you lose them, they're easier to find than ever before.

 To start, the AirPods Pro features [active noise cancellation (ANC)](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-sharing-twitch-on-your-fb-page-for-2024/), while the [standard AirPods model](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHB9Y8H?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208533&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F757335%2Fbest-ipad-accessory%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) doesn't. In addition, Spatial Audio is much improved in the new AirPods Pro. While this is nice for music, Spatial Audio is even better for watching movies on your iPad. With head tracking turned on, it sounds like the movie is playing from a speaker in the room rather than your earbuds.

 If you have an [iPhone](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/play-mkv-movies-on-moto-g24-is-it-possible-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mkv-on-android/) or [MacBook](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-to-minecraft-live-streaming-for-2024/) the AirPods Pro will easily follow you from device to device. Apple uses iCloud to detect which device you're using at a given time, automatically piping audio to your AirPods Pro without you needing to switch.

 The charging case has also seen a major update since the original. It has a built-in speaker and Find My integration to make lost earbuds a thing of the past. The new case also has more ways to charge, with support for USB-C, MagSafe, Qi wireless charging, and even the Apple Watch charger.

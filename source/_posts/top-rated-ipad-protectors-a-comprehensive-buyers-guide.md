##  What to Look for in an iPad Case in 2023

 Picking a case for your iPad can be a daunting experience. You need to know what you want the case to do, as well as your budget. A [Magic Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Keyboard-iPad-11-inch/dp/B0931V9M9D?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208500&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F758054%2Fbest-ipad-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) might be a great keyboard case many turn to, but given its price, it may not be the best option for you if you don't plan on [using your iPad like a laptop](https://win-dash.techidaily.com/1722972482843-corsair-void-pro-windows-driver-download-and-installation-made-simple/) a lot.

 Once you know what you plan on using your iPad for, you can start shopping for a case---but you need to make sure you're shopping for the right iPad model! Our buying guides below help you find the right case at the right size.

##  Best iPad (9th Generation) Cases

 While a new generation of the standard iPad is available, Apple is still supporting the ninth-generation iPad. If you're looking to pick up this iPad version, make sure you get the right case. The two generation's cases are incompatible, so double-check which generation you bought.

##  Best iPad Mini Cases

 If you need a compact tablet, look no further than the iPad Mini. This smaller model has all the functionality you love from Apple, but is easier to slide into a purse or bag.

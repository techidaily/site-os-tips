### Key Takeaways

* Pitaka MagEZ Car Mount Pro 2 is a car phone mount that includes wireless charging capabilities.
* It has unnecessary NFC features that require extra steps to use and doesn't include a USB-A adapter.
* The mount is secure and sturdy, but it is expensive compared to other options on the market.

 The [Pitaka MagEZ Car Mount Pro 2](http://www.amazon.com/PITAKA-Magnetic-Charger-Rotation-Universal/dp/B0CJY58WS7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001952&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fpitaka-magez-car-mount-pro-2-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) provides a secure fit for your MagSafe-supported smartphone while charging it wirelessly up to 15W. Beyond this, the accessory includes NFC capabilities you probably won’t use and doesn’t include a USB-A adapter you almost certainly would.

 Most cars nowadays come with pre-installed software like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which lets you access content from your iPhone or Android-based device on your car's infotainment system. However, this isn't possible if you have an older car, a new GM, or a Tesla that doesn't support the technology. In these cases, you may want to consider a car mount to use your phone while in transit.

 Like similar tools, the Pitaka MagEZ Car Mount Pro 2 attaches to your car's air vents, giving you easy access to your phone. It also includes wireless charging capabilities, is easy to move, and more.

 To use the $59.99 car mount, your phone must have Apple MagSafe or be secured in a MagSafe-supported case. Integrated magnets connect the phone to the car mount. For viewing flexibility, the mount includes a 17mm universal swivel ball that lets you adjust it 360 degrees. At the end is a plastic attachment that goes into the air vents horizontally. The mount comes with a USB-C to USB-C charging cable. If your car includes a USB-A port, you'll need to buy a separate connector, which adds to the price of the setup.

 After installing my mount review unit, I took my car out for a few drives to see how it worked. Connecting the car mount to my iPhone 15 Pro Max and air vents was simple. Adjusting the car mount position using the swivel ball was also quick and easy, although I wouldn't recommend doing this when driving the car; keep your eyes on the road!

 The mount, and perhaps more importantly, my phone, survived the road conditions. I drove my car on the highway, up and down hills, and on gravel during my tests. At no time did my phone fall off the mount or even shake. It was secure.

##  Something Unique: NFC Actions Aren't Needed

![Pitaka MagEZ Car Mount Pro 2 showing the NFC switch.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/02/pitaka-magez-car-mount-pro-2-showing-switch2.jpg)

 The Pitaka MagEZ Car Mount Pro 2 has built-in NFC capabilities, which are unique for these types of products. You can automatically activate an app from your phone using NFC shortcuts when it comes in contact. For example, your iPhone could automatically start Apple Music or open your Maps app. The mount includes a three-position switch that makes it possible to create three NFC shortcuts. To activate the mount's NFC capabilities, you use either the Apple Shortcuts app for iPhone or Modes and Routines on Android-based devices. I set up three NFC shortcuts on my iPhone using the Shortcuts app.

 The NFC setup process is relatively carefree, although reviewing the [online document](https://www.ipitaka.com/pages/pitalink-guide) Pitaka has provided is essential. The shortcuts work as expected once the setup is complete, although I question their usefulness.

 Intuitively, you'd expect these shortcuts to activate automatically whenever you connect the phone to the car mount. However, this isn't the case. Instead, before attaching the phone to the mount, you must tap the top of your device to the bottom of the mount to activate a shortcut. Once activated, the app will automatically open and perform the shortcut you requested. You'll see a message on your phone screen when this occurs. Instead of going through all this trouble, it's much easier to connect the phone to the mount and start an app using your fingers like always. Or, in the case of the iPhone, ask Siri to do it.

 One final point about the NFC shortcuts: the NFC switch is located _under_ the MagSafe surface. This design makes moving between the three switch positions impossible while the phone is connected to the mount. While most folks probably won't be switching back and forth between shortcuts that often, the design is somewhat goofy nonetheless. Putting the switch on the back of the product would have made it much easier to use.

 I’m not sure how much was added to the cost of the car mount to include NFC capabilities, but it certainly isn't worth it.

##  Should You Buy the Pitaka MagEZ Car Mount Pro 2?

 This minimalist car mount looks nice and feels sturdy out of the box. An easy and quick setup means using it comes about after just a few seconds. And yet, a few things about it cause me to pause on any recommendation.

 First, the price is excessive; it's about three times the price of the [best car mounts](https://howto.techidaily.com/7-fixes-for-unfortunately-phone-has-stopped-on-itel-p55-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) on the market. Second, I can't get past knowing that most folks who buy this mount will also need an extra accessory to work with USB-A. Finally, I question the need for NFC. It's one of those features firmly in the gimmick category. I didn't find the fancy feature convincing. Pitaka could have included a USB-A cable or adapter, however, to fit a common port in cars.

 The [Pitaka MagEZ Car Mount Pro 2](http://www.amazon.com/PITAKA-Magnetic-Charger-Rotation-Universal/dp/B0CJY58WS7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001952&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fpitaka-magez-car-mount-pro-2-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) gets the job done. Equally solid products are available, and in most cases, they are much less expensive.

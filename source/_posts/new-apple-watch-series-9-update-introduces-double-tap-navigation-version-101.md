## New Apple Watch Series 9 Update Introduces Double-Tap Navigation - Version 10.1

The [Apple Watch Series 9](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/demystifying-the-symbolism-of-a-blue-marker-in-facebook-chats/) and [Apple Watch Ultra 2](https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-mastering-your-youtube-pinpointing-a-specialized-audience/) launched without one of their flagship features—the creative Double Tap gesture. But Double Tap is now rolling out with the watchOS 10.1 update. Older models of Apple Watch also gain some improvements with this update, most notably [NameDrop](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-revolutionize-virtual-participation-with-top-10-free-recorder-software/) support.

 Double Tap allows you to quickly answer calls, reply to messages, scroll through Smart Stacks, and perform other common tasks. Simply touch your index finger and thumb together twice to trigger the quick action. When this gesture is performed successfully, a Double Tap icon will appear at the top of your Apple Watch. (When Double Tap isn't supported by a certain app or screen, the Double Tap icon will shake from side to side.)

 Only the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 support Double Tap. This gesture doesn't work when Low Power Mode or Sleep Focus are active. It's also incompatible with some accessibility features (Apple doesn't specify which).

 The watchOS 10.1 update also enables NameDrop on the Apple Watch Series 7 and later (plus the Watch Ultra series and Watch SE Gen 2). NameDrop is a cool feature that lets you transfer contact info to another person by [holding two Apple devices together](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-revolutionize-virtual-participation-with-top-10-free-recorder-software/). You can use NameDrop between two Apple Watches, for example, or use it between an Apple Watch and an iPhone.

 There are several bug fixes in watchOS 10.1, of course. Apple addressed a syncing issue for the Weather app on iPhone and Apple Watch, it patched a bug in Apple Watch's elevation system, and it fixed the Apple Watch Home app's broken climate section.

 You should receive a notification that asks you to install watchOS 10.1—if not, you can manually install the update by opening the Apple Watch app on an iPhone running iOS 17 (install iOS 17 by opening Settings, going to "General," and selecting "Software Update" on your iPhone). Note that the Apple Watch must be placed on a charger during the update process. If your battery is below 50%, the update won't install, so you may want to do this as you're getting ready for bed.

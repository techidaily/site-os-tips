## Mark Your Calendars: Apple Announces the Scheduled Date for Its Upcoming iPhone 15 Launch

Apple almost always reveals new iPhone models in September or October, so we've been expecting to hear more details about this year's iPhone 15 series. Sure enough, Apple has now confirmed a date for the launch event: September 12.

 Apple has sent out invitations for an event at its headquarters, which will take place on September 12, 2023 at 10 AM Pacific Time (1 PM Eastern Time). The company didn't explicitly say what the event will cover, but it's all but certain we'll see the introduction of the iPhone 15 series. The phones aren't expected to be too different than last year's iPhone 14 series, but the "Dynamic Island" from the iPhone 14 Pro will [could show up on both models](https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-apple-id-from-iphone-14-pro-max-without-password-by-drfone-ios/), there might be a customizable Action button replacing the mute switch, and the Lightning port might finally be replaced with a USB Type-C connector.

 The updated port would make the iPhone compliant with new regulations from the [European Union](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/step-by-step-tips-on-how-to-get-your-playstation-5-controller-to-charge-properly-again/) and [India](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-elite-women-gaming-leaders-top-10-on-yt/), which now require USB-C on smartphones to reduce e-waste from proprietary chargers. There's nothing stopping Apple from continuing to sell the iPhone with a Lightning port in the United States if it wanted, but recent rumors make it seem like all regions will get the standard USB Type-C connector. Apple might only support [higher data transfer speeds on the Pro model](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/16/iphone-15-high-speed-data-transfer/), though, with the regular model sticking to USB 2.0 speeds.

 We might also see new Apple Watches at the event. It's possible Apple might introduce the Series 9 at the event, as well as a new version of the Apple Watch Ultra, but it's unclear exactly what might be different compared to previous models. According to a _Bloomberg_ report, the Series 9 will have [a newer chipset](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/apple-watch-series-9-updated-chip/) based on the A15 used in the iPhone 15 series, which could provide performance and battery life improvements to the watches. There might be other product launches at the event, too, but we'll have to wait and see.

 If you want to watch the event live, Apple usually has a livestream for its events on the company's [YouTube channel](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2000152/https://www.youtube.com/user/Apple) and [website](https://www.apple.com/).

## Californians Can Now Use iPhones as Official Digital Identification

iPhone owners in California will soon have one more reason to leave their wallets at home. The company announced Thursday that Apple Wallet is adding support for the state's driver's licenses and state identification this fall.

 “We’re excited to be working with the state of California to bring IDs in Apple Wallet to Apple’s home state soon, and provide residents with an easy, secure, and private way to present their California driver’s license and state ID in person and in app using Apple Wallet,” Jennifer Bailey, VP of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet, [said in a press statement](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/08/drivers-licenses-and-state-ids-in-apple-wallet-are-coming-soon-to-california/).

 “Whether using IDs in Apple Wallet to breeze through travel, or to securely verify age or identity at businesses," she continued, "California driver’s licenses and state IDs in Apple Wallet make ID presentment seamless—all with the security built into iPhone and Apple Watch." The company is quick to point out however that travelers will only be able to show their digital IDs at "select TSA security checkpoints" to verify their age. Currently, the TSA checkpoints at the BWI, DCA, PHX, DEN, and ATL airports accept digital IDs.

 You can also present it as proof of age or identity at various businesses and entertainment venues that have "compliant mobile ID readers" installed. Your physical ID card [will still be needed the rest of the time](https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-a-beginners-journey-to-selecting-the-right-action-cam/). California joins Arizona, Maryland, Colorado, Georgia, [and Ohio](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/augmented-reality-explained-simply-for-2024/) in enjoying Apple Wallet support.

 Apple appears to be taking stringent steps to [keep user data secured](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/1716183782712-updated-2024-approved-how-to-edit-vertical-videos-for-instagram-in-final-cut-pro-x/). Your ID information is encrypted and stored locally on the device, and neither Apple nor the state agency that issued the ID can track when and where it's been presented. When you add your California ID to the system, for example, the DMV will receive "only \[the\] information they need to approve or deny," adding the ID to Apple Wallet.

 Similarly, only the information needed to complete a given transaction is shown when you display your digital ID, and you'll get the chance to review and authorize what's shared using Face ID or Touch ID. That way you won't have to worry about people snaking your home address or other personal information [when you are carded at bars and businesses](https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/efficient-techniques-for-accessing-and-saving-vimeo-videos/), as well as in government buildings.

 You won't have to unlock or hand over your device to present ID, either. And should you lose your device, Find My App allows you to either retrieve it, or remotely wipe the ID information from it.

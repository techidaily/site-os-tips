## Quick and Easy Methods for Sharing Images via iMessage

### Key Takeaways

* The iPhone Messages app in iOS 17 has replaced the messy row of iMessage apps with a plus button, making it easier to navigate.
* Despite the improved design, frequently used shortcuts like sharing photos and videos are now hidden in an extra menu.
* However, there is a simple shortcut to bypass the menu - just tap and hold the plus button to open the media selection menu and easily select a photo or video.

 The iPhone Messages app in [iOS 17](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-facebook-insights-how-to-use-it-for-beginners-easily/) removed the messy row of iMessage apps. Instead, there's just a plus (+) button. The downside is it requires an extra tap to share a photo—or does it? We'll show you a quick shortcut.

 The plus button is a definite improvement over the row of icons, many of which you probably never used. However, the shortcuts you do actually use—like sharing photos and videos—are now hidden behind an extra menu. The good news is there's a shortcut that bypasses the menu entirely.

 First, open the Messages app and go to a conversation.

 All you need to do is tap and hold the plus (+) button next to the text box until the media selection menu opens.

 Now, you can select a photo or video like you normally would. It's really that easy!

 The menu is customizable as well. You can tap and hold an app in the list to rearrange the order.

 The apps can also be moved in or out of the "More" section in the same way.

 That's all there is to it! Apple gave the Messages app [a lot of attention in iOS 17](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/assessing-data-protection-risks-in-using-chatgpt-technology/). Some of the other additions include a safety feature called "Check In," a bunch of enhancements for Stickers, better search filters, and more.

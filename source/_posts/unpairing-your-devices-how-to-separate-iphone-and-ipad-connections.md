### Key Takeaways

 To unsync Apple services and apps between your iPhone and iPad, go to your iPad's settings, tap your name, select "iCloud," and under "Apps Using iCloud" choose "Show All." Toggle off the services you want to unsync.

 Device syncing is a slick experience built into Apple's ecosystem. However, there can be instances where you might want to unsync your iPhone from your iPad, whether for privacy reasons, data management, or simply wanting different experiences on different devices.

##  Why Unsync Your iPad and iPhone?

 The syncing feature within the Apple ecosystem allows for easy information sharing between devices. For example, your text messages can show up on your [iPad](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-capturing-screen-content-on-huawei-mate-10-20-and-p-series-phones-via-built-in-recorders/), calls to your [iPhone](https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-quick-vimeo-transformation-tips-easy-to-create-gifs/) can ring on your iPad, and apps you download on one device can automatically appear on the other. While this is great for convenience and continuity, there are reasons you might want to unsync your devices.

 Perhaps you share an iPad with a family member and don't want your personal iPhone data appearing on that shared device. Maybe you're using your iPad for a specific purpose and want to keep its apps and data separate from your iPhone. Or you don't want a call to your iPhone interrupting your iPad movie-watching. Whatever the reason, let's look at how you can unsync your devices.

###  Disable Handoff

[Handoff](https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/guide-to-correcting-windows-10-issue-0xc19001e1-for-a-stable-operating-environment/) is a feature that allows you to start a task on one device and pick up where you left off on another. If you don't want this level of integration between your iPhone and iPad, you can disable Handoff.

 Open Settings on the device you want to disable Handoff on, tap on "General," select "AirPlay & Handoff," and toggle off "Handoff."

![IPad Settings Tap On User Name](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1.jpg) 

###  Fully Remove Your Apple ID

 If you want to completely stop syncing between your iPhone and iPad, you can remove your Apple ID from one of the devices.

 Open Settings on the device you want to remove your Apple ID from, tap on your Apple ID banner at the top of the screen.

![IPad Settings Tap On User Name](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1.jpg) 

 Scroll to the bottom and tap "Sign Out," enter [your Apple ID password](https://techidaily.com/why-stellar-data-recovery-for-iphone-6-plus-takes-time-in-scanning-my-iphone-stellar-by-stellar-data-recovery-ios-iphone-data-recovery/), and tap "Turn Off."

![IPad Settings Tap On User Name](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1.jpg) 

 Remember, removing your Apple ID will also mean losing access to purchases associated with that ID on the device, so be careful with this option.

 Now you know how to unsync your iPhone and iPad. It's all about setting up each device to your liking and needs. If you ever change your mind, remember that you can always change these settings back to sync your devices again.

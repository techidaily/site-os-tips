##  What to Look For in an iPhone 15 Pro Case in 2023

 If you’ve got a case for your iPhone 14 Pro lying around, you may wonder if it will fit the iPhone 15 Pro. The new phone is ever so slightly smaller than its predecessor, with a different shape to the curves on the edges, so while you may be able to make it fit, it won’t fit securely. If you intend to use your phone with any regularity, you’ll need a new case.

 One of the major differences between cases is the thickness and form factor, so you’ll need to decide what you’re looking for here first. Thinner cases may not offer quite as much protection, but they’re far less bulky and make an easier fit for pockets. Bulkier cases offer more protection and features, but they will make your phone feel considerably larger.

 If you frequently drop your phone or use it on a heavy-duty worksite, you’ll want extra protection. Rugged cases are bulkier than normal cases, but they offer significantly more protection, which can keep your iPhone 15 Pro in working order well beyond what a typical case would do. On the other hand, these are even tougher to fit in a pocket or bag.

 You’ll also need to consider the material you use. Many cases are made from [thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-steamvr-issues-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide/), sometimes in conjunction with plastic composite. This offers plenty of protection and is fairly affordable, but there are other options like leather, fabric, and even cases that use wood for some extra style points.

 You’ll also need to decide on the type of look and special features you want in a case. Clear cases let you see your iPhone’s finish while keeping it protected, while others use built-in magnets to support [Apple’s MagSafe accessories](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/mastering-regional-adjustments-how-to-update-regions-on-your-iphone/). Other cases double as wallets, letting you leave your normal wallet at home.

 Finally, you need to choose how much you want to spend. Affordable cases still offer plenty of protection, while paying more will typically get you super-rugged builds, fancier materials, or extra features.

| Pros                                            | Cons                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| MagSafe compatibility                           | Only two colors available                |
| Air Cushion technology provides good protection | Chevron texture won't appeal to everyone |
| Inexpensive                                     |                                          |

 No one wants to break their smartphone, which is why a case that offers good protection so you don't need to deal with expensive repairs. However, some of the most protective cases are thick and bulky, making you unable to use MagSafe accessories or wireless charging. Spigen reaches a good middle ground with the [Mag Armor MagFit](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Magnetic-Military-Grade-Protection-Compatible/dp/B0C5S6THJ5?th=1&tag=htg-v2-1cgil05-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000428&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) case, offering the best of both worlds for a good price to boot.

 The Mag Armor case is made with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), and the back has a textured chevron pattern. The pattern is for more than looks, however—the rectangular texture also helps with gripping the phone.

 In addition, Spigen's Air Cushion technology puts pockets of air into the case, helping the Mag Armor absorb shocks and protect your smartphone from damage.

 The biggest problem with this Spigen case is, unfortunately, it's only available in two colors: [Matte Black](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Magnetic-Military-Grade-Protection-Compatible/dp/B0C5S6THJ5?th=1&tag=htg-v2-1cgil05-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000428&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [Navy Blue](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Magnetic-Military-Grade-Protection-Compatible/dp/B0C5S87YGR?th=1&tag=htg-v2-1cgil05-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000428&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). These are both relatively neutral colorways though, so if you aren't looking for brighter colors this won't be a dealbreaker.

 Finding the perfect budget case for your iPhone doesn’t mean you must skimp on either protection or features. For proof, look no further than the [Caseology Parallax Mag for iPhone 15 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Caseology-Parallax-Enhanced-Ergonomic-Compatible/dp/B0C63VWJVJ/?tag=htg-v2-1cgil05-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000428&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which offers solid protection and features you’d expect to sell for a much higher price.

 This case is made from TPU and is certified with military-grade drop protection. Of course, it’s better never to drop your phone at all, which is where Caseology’s 3D Hexa Cube Design on the back is beneficial. This gives you a textured grip, making it easier to hold onto the phone.

 Despite its low price, the Caseology Parallax Mag features built-in magnets, making it compatible with MagSafe chargers and other accessories. The case is also wireless charging compatible.

Best Budget iPhone 15 Pro Case

#####  Caseology Parallax Mag for iPhone 15 Pro

The Caseology Parallax Mag for iPhone 15 Pro may be budget friendly, but it's anything but cheaply built, with a Hexa Cube design to prevent drops and even support for MagSafe chargers and accessories.

[See at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Caseology-Parallax-Enhanced-Ergonomic-Compatible/dp/B0C63VWJVJ/?tag=htg-v2-1cgil05-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000428&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

| Drop tested up to 50 fimes at 6 feet          | Design means no MagSafe or wireless charging |
| Minimalist design holds three cards plus cash |                                              |

 Wallet cases can be unnecessarily bulky, and while that’s fine if you want the extra protection for your screen, some people want a slimmer, sleeker option. The [Smartish Wallet Slayer Vol. 2 for iPhone 15 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Smartish-iPhone-Pro-Wallet-Case/dp/B0C7HJF6GH/?tag=htg-v2-1cgil05-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000428&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) does away with the folio-style front flap found on many cases, allowing storage on the back of the case.

 The back of the Wallet Slayer Vol. 2 features space for three cards plus any cash you’re carrying. This may be a slightly tight fit, depending on the size of the cards, so Smartish helpfully added a thumb slot to make it easy to remove the cards. The downside of placing everything on the back is that this case isn’t compatible with MagSafe accessories or wireless charging.

 Another interesting feature of this case is the credit card kickstand, which lets you use a card to prop up the phone.

 There is no getting around the fact that, despite the protection they offer, rugged cases add significant bulk to your phone. While this is unavoidable, a rugged case doesn’t have to make your phone look like heavy equipment, as the [URBAN ARMOR GEAR Civilian for iPhone 15 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/URBAN-ARMOR-GEAR-Compatible-Protective/dp/B0CCKRTHSB/?tag=htg-v2-1cgil05-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000428&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) case shows.

 URBAN ARMOR GEAR is known for its rugged cases, and many of them look the part. The Civilian is still unabashedly rugged, but the look isn’t quite as heavy-duty as other UAG cases. It’s also lightweight, compatible with MagSafe chargers, and is military grade drop tested up to 20 feet, a distance from which most people rarely drop their phones.

 The URBAN ARMOR GEAR Civilian for iPhone 15 Pro features raised bezels around the screen and camera to protect your phone’s glass elements.

Best Rugged iPhone 15 Pro Case

#####  Urban Armor Gear Civilian for iPhone 15 Pro

The Urban Armor Gear Civilian for iPhone 15 Pro is a rugged case for maximum protection, but it doesn't look as outlanding as some other rugged cases can, letting your phone blend in instead of sticking out,

 What’s the point of buying a phone as stunning as the iPhone 15 Pro, only to cover up its finish immediately. You have two choices—opt not to use a case and risk damaging your phone, or choose a clear case and have protection while still being able to see your phone. The [ESR for iPhone 15 Pro Case](https://www.amazon.com/ESR-Compatible-Military-Grade-Protection-Scratch-Resistant/dp/B0CC1F5CGH?tag=htg-v2-1cgil05-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000428&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) even offers colorful yet clear options.

 This case might be clear, but it’s tough, with military-grade drop protection and raised bezels to protect your screen and camera lenses. Specially designed Air Guard corners protect against drops where the corner of the phone hits, which can be the most damaging. This case also features built-in magnets for compatibility with MagSafe chargers and accessories.

 This clear case is available on its own, or as a bundle with a tempered glass screen protector. In addition to the standard clear finish, you get semi-clear options like [Clear Black](https://www.amazon.com/ESR-Compatible-Military-Grade-Protection-Scratch-Resistant/dp/B0CC1CSTSV?tag=htg-v2-1cgil05-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000428&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Clear Dark Blue](https://www.amazon.com/ESR-Compatible-Military-Grade-Protection-Scratch-Resistant/dp/B0CC1CSS23?tag=htg-v2-1cgil05-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000428&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [Frosted Black](https://www.amazon.com/ESR-Compatible-Military-Grade-Protection-Scratch-Resistant/dp/B0CC1BK4DG?tag=htg-v2-1cgil05-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000428&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

If you still want the protection of a case but can’t stand the bulk, the [TORRAS Magnetic Slim Fit Designed for iPhone 15 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-Magnetic-Compatible-Kickstand-Anti-Fingerprint/dp/B0CBCD3DXG/?tag=htg-v2-1cgil05-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000428&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-pro-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a great option thanks to its combination of form and function.

 This case is only 0.03 inches thick and weighs in at just 0.61 ounces, so you’re not adding nearly as much to the weight or dimensions of your phone as with many other cases. This model features built-in magnets, so you don’t have to give up the benefits of using MagSafe accessories. In a unique touch, the ring around the camera flips up to act as a kickstand.

 The TORRAS Magnetic Slim Fit also features a soft-touch coating that adds grip, making your phone easier to hold on to. This also resists scratches and fingerprints.

 With Apple no longer making leather cases, other manufacturers have taken up the slack, and Nomad makes some of the best cases available. While the cases are great for any iPhone, Nomad saves its best leather for the Pro series iPhones, making the [Nomad Modern Horween Leather Case for iPhone 15](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2000428%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fmodern-leather-case-horween-black-iphone-15-pro) the best leather case you can buy.

[Horween](https://www.horween.com/) is an American company that specializes in leather wallets and other accessories, and this case is just as luxurious as the company’s other leather products. Nomad applies its own touches here, using a TPU interior to give your phone extra protection. Despite the traditional look, these cases feature internal magnets for compatibility with MagSafe chargers.

 Nomad promises the leather gracefully ages over time, gaining character without simply wearing out.

## FAQ

### Can I use my iPhone 14 Pro case with the iPhone 15 Pro? 

 No. The iPhone 15 Pro is slightly smaller than the iPhone 14 Pro, and it has differently curved edges, so while an older case may technically fit, it won’t fit securely.

### Can I use my iPhone 15 case with the iPhone 15 Pro? 

 No. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro are slightly different sizes, but also have different camera sizes, so the cases aren’t interchangeable.

### Can I use my Lightning cable with the iPhone 15 Pro? 

 No. Like every other iPhone 15 model, the iPhone 15 Pro uses a USB-C connector, which won’t fit a Lightning cable.

### How do I clean my phone case?

 This depends on the material the case uses. While TPU and PC cases are easy to clean with a cloth and water or alcohol, other materials may require more care.This depends on the material the case uses.

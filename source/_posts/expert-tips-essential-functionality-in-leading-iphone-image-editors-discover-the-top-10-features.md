 Apple has been gradually infusing the iPhone Photos app with awesome, powerful features. It's really much more than the basic default gallery app of old. There are a lot of features you may not know about---we'll share some of the best.

##  Search Your iPhone Photos Like a Pro

![Searching for text within the iPhone Photos app](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/text_search.jpg?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1) 

 You probably have hundreds---if not thousands---of photos and videos in the Photos app. Thankfully, there is [powerful search and filters in the Photos app](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamline-your-virtual-adventure-with-kinemaster-tips-and-competitor-analysis/) to help you find what you need. You can simply search for "cat" to bring up all photos of cats, and even search for text that appears in photos.

##  Remove the Background From Photos

![iOS 16 isolated subject](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ios_16_subject.png?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1) 

[iOS 16](https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/s-best-video-editors-for-mac-pinnacle-studio-alternates/) and [iPadOS 16](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-do-live-streaming-with-periscope/) added a super cool feature to [the Photos app that allows you to isolate subjects from the background](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-navigating-the-complexities-of-gesture-recognition/). This is something you would normally need an app such as Photoshop to do, but it can be done with the Photos app in just a few taps. It even works with videos.

##  Enable the "Hidden" Photo Album

![Tap &quot;Hidden&quot; under Utilities](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/hidden-album.png?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1) 

 Look, there are probably some photos and videos that you don't want just anyone to be able to see on your iPhone. For that, the Photos app has a [password-protected "Hidden" album](https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-enhancing-stardew-experience-discovering-the-top-7-modifications/) that can be enabled. As an added layer of security, you can even hide the album itself.

##  Turn Off Audio on Live Photos

![Tap the &quot;Live Photo&quot; button in the toolbar.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tap_live_photo_button.jpg?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1) 

 "Live Photos" is a cool feature that turns regular photos into short videos. What you might not know about Live Photos is they also record audio. Thankfully, [you can turn off audio from Live Photos very easily](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/recommended-best-applications-for-mirroring-your-realme-narzo-n55-screen-drfone-by-drfone-android/). Simply open the photo, tap "Edit," and toggle off audio in the Live Photo options. You can keep the video while removing the audio.

##  Batch Edit Photos and Videos

![Hit &quot;Copy Edits&quot; to copy your edits to clipboard](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/copy_edits_edit.jpg?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1) 

 Editing photos on an iPhone is a relatively easy process---probably easier than it is on a computer. However, it can be cumbersome if you have a lot to edit. [The Photos app allows you to "copy" edits from one photo or video to another](https://howto.techidaily.com/top-4-android-system-repair-software-for-htc-u23-bricked-devices-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/). That way, you can edit once and apply it to a bunch of other photos and videos. Pretty cool.

##  Find and Delete Duplicate Photos and Videos

![Scroll to the &quot;Utilities&quot; section on the &quot;Albums&quot; tab](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/duplicates_option.jpg?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1) 

 Your iPhone only has so much space---and you may not want to shell out for more iCloud storage---which means keeping photos and videos tidy is important. The Photos app has a feature that [automatically detects duplicate photos and videos for you to delete](https://ai-topics.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-what-is-chatgpt/). Use this feature to clear out space when you need it.

##  Delete Location Info from Photos

![Select &quot;No Location&quot; to remove geotag from photo.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Select-no-location-to-remove-details-from-phoot.png?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1) 

 The Photos app [allows you to see EXIF data for photos](https://ai-topics.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-what-is-chatgpt/). This gives you information about which device took the photo, when, and---[if you haven't disabled location](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-5-pinnacle-clippers-for-your-mac-experience-for-2024/)\---where. You can [remove the location from the EXIF data from iPhone photos](https://fox-links.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exploring-the-power-of-gopro-burst-mode/) very easily, which you may want to do before sending photos to people who you don't want to have your location.

Did you know [the Photos app can identify things for you?](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/is-private-information-at-risk-when-using-chatgpt-understanding-potential-pitfalls/) The feature generally works for plants, animals, art, and landmarks. All you have to do is look for the little sparkle icon on top of the "Info" button when looking at a photo.

##  Scan Text from Photos

 Speaking of identifying things, [the iPhone Photos app can also identify text in photos](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-lifelike-broadcasts-which-aspect-holds-the-high-ground/) and allow you to copy it. Simply open a photo that contains text, tap the scanning icon in the bottom corner, and watch all the text get highlighted. From there, you can select the text and copy it, look it up, translate, or share.

 There are a lot of apps that request access to the photos on your iPhone. It can be downright impossible to remember which apps have access, and some you may not want to have access forever. The good news is you can [easily see which apps have photo access in the iPhone's Privacy settings](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-ace-virtual-imagery-ideal-google-meet-screens/).

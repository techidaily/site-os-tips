 Apple has been gradually infusing the iPhone Photos app with awesome, powerful features. It's really much more than the basic default gallery app of old. There are a lot of features you may not know about---we'll share some of the best.

##  Search Your iPhone Photos Like a Pro

![Searching for text within the iPhone Photos app](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/text_search.jpg?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1) 

 You probably have hundreds---if not thousands---of photos and videos in the Photos app. Thankfully, there is [powerful search and filters in the Photos app](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamline-your-virtual-adventure-with-kinemaster-tips-and-competitor-analysis/) to help you find what you need. You can simply search for "cat" to bring up all photos of cats, and even search for text that appears in photos.

##  Remove the Background From Photos

![iOS 16 isolated subject](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ios_16_subject.png?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1) 

[iOS 16](https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/s-best-video-editors-for-mac-pinnacle-studio-alternates/) and [iPadOS 16](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-do-live-streaming-with-periscope/) added a super cool feature to [the Photos app that allows you to isolate subjects from the background](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-navigating-the-complexities-of-gesture-recognition/). This is something you would normally need an app such as Photoshop to do, but it can be done with the Photos app in just a few taps. It even works with videos.

##  Enable the "Hidden" Photo Album

![Tap &quot;Hidden&quot; under Utilities](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/hidden-album.png?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1)

 Look, there are probably some photos and videos that you don't want just anyone to be able to see on your iPhone. For that, the Photos app has a [password-protected "Hidden" album](https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-enhancing-stardew-experience-discovering-the-top-7-modifications/) that can be enabled. As an added layer of security, you can even hide the album itself.

 "Live Photos" is a cool feature that turns regular photos into short videos. What you might not know about Live Photos is they also record audio. Thankfully, [you can turn off audio from Live Photos very easily](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/recommended-best-applications-for-mirroring-your-realme-narzo-n55-screen-drfone-by-drfone-android/). Simply open the photo, tap "Edit," and toggle off audio in the Live Photo options. You can keep the video while removing the audio.

 Editing photos on an iPhone is a relatively easy process---probably easier than it is on a computer. However, it can be cumbersome if you have a lot to edit. [The Photos app allows you to "copy" edits from one photo or video to another](https://howto.techidaily.com/top-4-android-system-repair-software-for-htc-u23-bricked-devices-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/). That way, you can edit once and apply it to a bunch of other photos and videos. Pretty cool.

##  Find and Delete Duplicate Photos and Videos

![Scroll to the &quot;Utilities&quot; section on the &quot;Albums&quot; tab](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/duplicates_option.jpg?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1) 

 Your iPhone only has so much space---and you may not want to shell out for more iCloud storage---which means keeping photos and videos tidy is important. The Photos app has a feature that [automatically detects duplicate photos and videos for you to delete](https://ai-topics.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-what-is-chatgpt/). Use this feature to clear out space when you need it.

##  Delete Location Info from Photos

![Select &quot;No Location&quot; to remove geotag from photo.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Select-no-location-to-remove-details-from-phoot.png?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1) 

 The Photos app [allows you to see EXIF data for photos](https://ai-topics.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-what-is-chatgpt/). This gives you information about which device took the photo, when, and---[if you haven't disabled location](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-5-pinnacle-clippers-for-your-mac-experience-for-2024/)\---where. You can [remove the location from the EXIF data from iPhone photos](https://fox-links.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exploring-the-power-of-gopro-burst-mode/) very easily, which you may want to do before sending photos to people who you don't want to have your location.

 Speaking of identifying things, [the iPhone Photos app can also identify text in photos](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-lifelike-broadcasts-which-aspect-holds-the-high-ground/) and allow you to copy it.

## Belkin Revolutionizes Charging Technology: Unveiling the Innovative MagSafe 3-Port Adapter

Belkin just revealed the BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Stand, a powerful and shiny charging accessory with a tilting MagSafe hinge. It's an interesting product that could make some of the iPhone's latest features more useful.

 Most MagSafe charging stands are non-adjustable. They look nice, but they can only accommodate a single viewing angle. The tilting hinge in Belkin's new charging stand could be useful when watching videos on the iPhone, but more importantly, it allows you to take full advantage of [Continuity Camera](https://dvd-bd.techidaily.com/diy-tutorial-transform-your-mp4-videos-into-a-professional-costless-dvd-with-ease/) and [StandBy mode](https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-here-are-different-ways-to-find-pokemon-go-trainer-codes-to-add-to-your-account-on-apple-iphone-6-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/).

 The Continuity Camera system turns your iPhone into a wireless Mac webcam. And StandBy mode, which rolled out in late 2023, makes it easier to see important information when glancing at the iPhone's screen. Neither of these features are made for hands-on interaction—Apple assumes that you will place the iPhone on some kind of stand. A non-adjustable stand can get the job done, but the BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1's adjustable hinge is far more useful.

 Bekin's BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 is explicitly made for iPhone users. That said, it complies with [Qi2 wireless charging](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/what-is-the-best-pokemon-for-pokemon-pvp-ranking-on-nokia-c110-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), which will provide 15-watt magnetic charging capabilities to some new Android phones. And the base of this stand, which is intended for AirPods, can also charge Android or iOS smartphones. Obviously, the integrated Apple Watch charger won't be too useful to Android users, but this accessory could find a place in homes that use both Android and iOS.

 At $150, the BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 isn't exactly cheap. But its price is comparable to other 3-in-1 MagSafe stands, such as the $100 [Mophie Snap](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-keep-it-flowing-repasting-content-on-ig/) and $150 [Twelve South Snap HiRise](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unending-screen-documentation-sites/). The BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1's tilting action is also a huge selling point, though you can achieve similar functionality with [cheaper accessories](https://www.amazon.com/Sonix-Magnetic-Adjustable-Pedestal-Compatible/dp/B08R56P21D/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001425&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbelkin-3-in-1-magsafe-charger-reveal%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). If you don't care about the Apple Watch charger, many 2-in-1 stands are substantially cheaper, such as [Anker's $45 PowerWave 2-in-1 Magnetic Stand Lite](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B094FMWPPM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001425&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbelkin-3-in-1-magsafe-charger-reveal%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 The BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Stand launches in March 2024\. If you don't own an Apple Watch, I suggest buying 2023's [BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-mastering-the-art-of-using-ez-grabber-with-this-tutorial-for-2024/) instead, as it costs a bit less money and omits the Apple Watch charger. Those who are interested in charging accessories should check out Belkin's new 200-watt GaN charger, which was revealed alongside the new BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1.

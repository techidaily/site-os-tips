Whether you have an old or new iPhone, it will get full storage when you keep large photos and videos or download many files. One solution for this inevitable event is to upgrade your iPhone and buy a new one with more storage or subscribe to the iCloud service for more cloud storage, but it will save you more money when you clean up your device. While deciding, you can read this post and see solutions that will benefit you.

## Part 1\. What Happens When iPhone Storage is Full

 If you disregard the ‚Äúlow storage space‚Äù notification, there is a chance your device will be reactive with full storage. You can visit the App Store and download an app, but your device will not install it at all. The iCloud Photo Library will also struggle to sync incoming files. Furthermore, your device‚Äôs performance is noticeably slow when opening the apps or browsing online due to the cluttered space.

 Meanwhile, iOS will keep reminding you of your almost full iPhone storage, and it is hard to get rid of it until you start to clean it up. Under such circumstances, Here are some warnings that are common for full storage on iPhones:

* iPhone Storage Almost Full- The phone is running low on storage space. It is suggested to uninstall some apps, delete duplicated photos, or use iCloud to free up more space.
* iPhone Storage Full- No more space is available for the incoming files. This will be the reason for failing to move on with further app installations, taking photos on the Camera app, and so on. Your device will also be unable to delete cache, data, and system files.
* App Storage Almost Full- This will be the notification when a particular app has reached the storage limit. You can use the Offload App feature to clean the app cache.

## Part 2\. Why is iPhone Storage Full When I Have iCloud

 iCloud is the extended storage space of an iPhone for photos, contacts, messages, videos, and more. But why is the phone still full even with a cloud service? The major reason is that iCloud backs up phone data, such as images, videos, and app data, but it won‚Äôt directly delete these local files on your iPhone. Other files it stores can be system files and cached data, which take up much space on your phone. So, the iCloud service works like an[external storage for your iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/) but doesn‚Äôt naturally affect your internal storage.

 Some iOS users suggest using optimization features, but even with these, the result is almost the same as having low enough space. This is because your device might not be up for more data, or in other term, it lacks on-device storage. Also, remember that iCloud is meant to back up all files on your phone and is not made to offload content from your iPhone to free up more space. So, you can delete unused apps and other files to keep the storage space in good condition. Check out the following part for various solutions.

 Music is also another factor why your iPhone storage is full. To delete some audio files, go to settings and tap theiPhone Storage menu. Find theMusic app and swipe left on the artist to delete them from the list. Optionally, you can delete specific albums, multiple songs, etc.

Why is my iPhone stuck on the Apple logo?

 If your iPhone storage is full, this will likely happen. Your phone needs constant updates and can fail to download the needed software if you are low in space. You can force restart the device to see if it will work out.

 What takes up the most storage on the iPhone?

 It depends on the user. The first thing that will likely take up more space on your phone is photos if you love taking pictures. Another possible answer is apps that have a lot of app data. Surprisingly, your browser can gobble more space if cache, cookies, and browsing history are not regularly deleted.

 What should I delete when my phone storage is full?

 Assess the iPhone storage first before jumping to deletion. The parameter that shows the storage capacity will be your guide to which files you have to delete. Then, add app data, browsing history, and messages to your list of deleting files.

How to increase iPhone storage?

 Delete files that are not needed, such as apps, temporary files, and large video files. You can also purchase a plan on iCloud to expand your phone storage.

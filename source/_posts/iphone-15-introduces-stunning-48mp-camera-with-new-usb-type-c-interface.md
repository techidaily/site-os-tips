## IPhone 15 Introduces Stunning 48MP Camera with New USB Type-C Interface

Apple has finally revealed the iPhone 15, following months of rumors, leaks, and anticipation, alongside the more premium [iPhone 15 Pro](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-direct-download-of-youtube-content/). Thankfully, this seems to be a much more substantial upgrade than [last year's iPhone 14](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-diy-tips-to-cut-unwanted-sounds-from-your-videos/), which didn't go much farther than satellite connectivity and the switch to eSIM.

 The regular iPhone 15 is once again available in two sizes: the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. Sadly, there's still no direct successor to the iPhone 13 Mini — your only options for a more compact model are the [iPhone SE 3](https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-phone-number-from-your-apple-id-from-your-apple-iphone-6s-plus-by-drfone-ios/) or an Android smartphone. The phones appear to be identical besides the screen sizes, with the base model offering a 6.1-inch display and the Plus having a 6.7-inch screen. That's identical to the regular and Plus sizes from last year's iPhone 14 series, and just like the earlier models, the phones have aluminum sides with a glass back. The screen also supports Dolby Vision, with a higher maximum brightness.

 Even though the screens are physically the same size, you do get a bit more screen real estate, as the camera notch has been replaced with [the same "Dynamic Island"](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-time-traveling-tactics-top-7-historic-battles-reimagined/) that Apple introduced in the iPhone 14 Pro. It also uses the same A16 chipset as the iPhone 14 Pro. It packs the front-facing camera and Face ID sensors into a slightly smaller package, and it can expand to display real-time alerts, media controls, and other functions as needed.

 There are a few other great improvements worth mentioning. The long-awaited switch from Lightning to USB-C for the main connector has finally arrived, which means the iPhone 15 should work seamlessly with all your existing USB-C chargers and cables. MagSafe wireless charging will also continue to work as expected. The primary rear camera now uses a 48MP sensor, instead of the 12MP camera found on the regular iPhone 14 series. The other camera is a 12MP telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom, which is primarily used for zoom shots and Portrait Mode.

 The iPhone 15 should be available to [purchase at the Apple Store](https://www.apple.com/store) soon, in addition to mobile carriers, which will likely offer different deals to entice new subscribers.

The price will be $799 for the base model, and $899 for the Plus model — the same as last year.

## Why Half of My Gaming Experience Takes Place on My iPhone: A Closer Look

### Key Takeaways

* The iPhone offers quality ports of indie games and noteworthy AAA titles, transforming the mobile gaming landscape.
* Navigating through the App Store can involve sifting through low-quality games, but you can combat this with word-of-mouth recommendations, player recommendations from sources like Reddit and gaming blogs, or by looking at featured App Store games.
* Cloud gaming services like PlayStation Remote Play provide a seamless gaming experience on iPhone under the right conditions.

 I've spent too long discounting the potential my iPhone has as a gaming platform, seeing it only as a communication device and little else. A recommendation from a friend changed all that, and now I'm telling you not to make the same mistake I did.

##  How Did I Get Here

 I never thought too much about using my iPhone 14 Plus much outside of communication and the occasional on-the-go video or photo edit. The idea of supplementing a collection of retro and current generation video game systems and peripherals with a less-than-powerful smartphone that I've come to associate only with children and free-to-play shovelware never crossed my mind.

 Slowly, word of mouth spread about the quality of the iOS port of [_Magic: the Gathering Arena_](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magic-the-gathering-arena/id1496227521). As a lifelong competitive MTG player, the idea of being able to comfortably compete in tournament-level events while waiting in line at the bank was enough to pique my interest.

 To my surprise, the game runs smoothly, the controls are intuitive, and I found myself grinding out Standard Ranked matches en masse. My "please don't bother me" approach to phone notifications allows for a fairly uninterrupted gaming experience. I am forever changed.

 The light of a telephone touch screen has started to melt my cold PC gamer heart. I had to see what else I was missing out on.

##  Sifting Through Seas of Shovelware

 My initial dive into the mobile software sea was stormier than expected. The early days of "buy it outright" game choice have been upended by a tidal wave of buggy free-to-play diet ransomware. With an endless barrage of garbage flooding the App Store, finding worthwhile titles takes time.

 Combing through user reviews, editor's picks, and clickbait lists can only get you a foot in the door. Dedicated resources like [Touch Arcade](https://toucharcade.com) and [Pocket Gamer](https://www.pocketgamer.com) can help a lot. Cross-referencing recommendations with the discussions found in communities of Reddit, Discord, or your gaming forum of choice is essential.

 Word of mouth is your best friend. The onset of my journey into the App Store was courtesy of friends pushing me to dabble in the dark arts of mobile gaming. Trust the directions given by those whom you know have sailed the course, especially if it's to a place you have yet to find.

 Aim for games that require a bit less precious time than you'd normally expect. There is a reason why puzzle games outsell platformers on mobile by an enormous margin. Ports of less control-heavy indie games are a great place to start. The quick but deep gameplay of titles like _[Vampire Survivors](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vampire-survivors/id6444525702)_ and _[Papers, Please](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/papers-please/id935216956)[](https://gamerant.com/papers-please-mobile/)_make for phone fodder of the highest order.

##  Triple-A Ports Come to iPhone at Last

 The iPhone can handle pocket-friendly ports of smaller titles, but the AAA gaming push has been a bit of a mixed bag. While the wound from the disastrous releaseâ€”and subsequent lawsuitâ€”of the iOS version of Fortnite hasn't quite stopped bleeding, there are outliers.

 Mobile ports of beloved titles like _[Call of Duty: Mobile](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/call-of-duty-mobile/id1287282214)_ and [_Genshin Impact_](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697) have managed to keep close enough to the spirit and gameplay of their console counterparts to have a dedicated fanbase of their own.

 As someone who slept on the initial PS4 release of Hideo Kojima's energy-drink branded walking sim _Death Stranding_, I was shocked to find out how much I enjoyed the mobile port of the director's cut. The power of [Apple's new A17 Pro chip](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ultimate-roundup-no-fee-videocalling-plus-live-desktop-share/) helps push the hardware and deliver a smooth experience on par with the original.

 Still, you're right to be skeptical when it comes to the viability of large titles going mobile. They often cost as much as their console counterparts, yet don't always offer the same level of performance or longevity. Apple's frequent updates can render older games unplayable, as happened to many early App Store favorites.

 The idea of attempting most AAA titles with the awkward lack of feedback that comes from touch controls is less than appealing. The addition of a [higher-end controller clip](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/navigate-funimates-complexities-with-ease-for-2024/) streamlines the experience and brings it more in line with the intended approach, but such a bulky addition is less convenience and veers into "I could have just taken my Steam Deck" territory.

##  Remote Play and Cloud Gaming Is Ready

 I was aware that services like [Xbox Cloud Gaming](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-cinematic-illumination-a-filmmakers-path-to-stunning-colors/) and [PlayStation Remote Play](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-vidgrabber-mobilepc-for-fb-streams/) reached a point that allowed a nearly flawless game-streaming experience, but my mobile skepticism hobbled any interest past a mildly impressed "oh, nice." But after the slow creep of curiosity started gaining momentum, I finally broke down and tested the waters of PlayStation Remote Play.

Xbox

 After near-misses of almost burning pancakes, because I spaced out in my kitchen while spending my test time rocking another quick _Crypt of the Necrodancer_ run, I realized just how well the iPhone can handle cloud gaming. Remote play works, it _really_ works. I mean full "this phone is now just a portable monitor and now I might need to buy a controller backbone" works.

 Especially for those without access to any of the [newer powerhouses of mobile gaming](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-the-insiders-guide-to-creating-stunning-iphone-hdr-photos/), the iPhone offers an unexpectedly robust alternative. All you need is an account, your app of choice, and you're ready to stream games from your home console either locally (for best results) or remotely (when you're away from home).

 That said, the need for a rock-solid internet connection can't be overstated if you're hoping to play away from your home network. A drop in connectivity can turn a full banger of a gaming session into a laggy, pixellated mess.

##  An Odd Future for Gaming

 The convenience of mobile gaming has entirely upended habits I thought to be unbreakable. The hours spent jamming _MTG: Arena_have moved from the silence of my office to the hum of a treadmill. Time melts away as I sweat and compete, as does my iPhone battery.

 It's a bold new direction for my gaming habit. Everything I have been looking for regarding gaming on-the-go has been in my pocket the entire time.

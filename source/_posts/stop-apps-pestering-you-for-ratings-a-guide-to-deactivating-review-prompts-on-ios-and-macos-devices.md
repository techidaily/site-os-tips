 User ratings and reviews help developers improve their apps but nagging users with in-app pop-ups asking for reviews or ratings isn't acceptable. Thankfully, Apple lets you turn off these pesky rating and review requests on your iPhone and Mac. Here's how.

##  Turn Off In-App Ratings and Reviews Pop-Ups on an iPhone or iPad

 If you're fed up with apps on your iPhone or iPad popping up rating and review requests every time you use them, you can turn off the in-app requests from the Settings app to settle this once and for all.

 Start by opening "Settings" on your iPhone or iPad and select "App Store."

 Scroll down to locate the "In-App Ratings & Reviews" option. Then, flip the toggle switch next to it off.

##  Turn Off In-App Ratings and Reviews Pop-Ups on a Mac

 Unlike on an iPhone or iPad, you can't disable in-app rating and review requests on a Mac from System Settings. Instead, you'll have to do so from the App Store Settings.

 First, launch the App Store on your Mac. Click on "App Store" in the menu bar and select "Settings." Alternatively, press the Command+, keyboard shortcut.

 In the "Settings" window, uncheck the checkbox next to "In-App Ratings & Reviews."

 With in-app rating and review pop-ups disabled, you won't be bothered by apps to rate or review them anymore. That said, it's important to mention that, in the past, some apps managed to find a way to bypass this setting and send rating and review notifications. However, Apple strongly discourages this, and it doesn't seem to be very common anymore.

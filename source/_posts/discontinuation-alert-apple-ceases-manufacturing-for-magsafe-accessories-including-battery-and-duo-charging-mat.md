## Discontinuation Alert: Apple Ceases Manufacturing for MagSafe Accessories Including Battery and Duo Charging Mat

### Key Takeaways

* Apple is transitioning to USB-C for its products, including the new iPhone 15 lineup, in compliance with upcoming EU regulations to reduce electronic waste.
* The discontinuation of the MagSafe Battery Pack and MagSafe Duo charging mat may be due to their high prices and competition from cheaper alternatives.
* While these products are no longer available on Apple's website, they can still be found at some retailers, but stock may be limited as customers rush to buy Lightning accessories before they are phased out.

 On September 12th, Apple took its first steps toward full USB-C adoption. The company debuted its iPhone 15 lineup, which is fully equipped with USB-C, plus a new AirPods Pro case that utilizes the charging standard. However, it seems that some Apple products will not be included in this transition. Apple no longer sells the [MagSafe Battery Pack](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-avoid-complexity-top-5-free-tools-for-effortless-gif-to-video-transformation/) or [MagSafe Duo](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXF3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08MWR2NXZ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000313&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fapples-magsafe-battery-and-magsafe-duo-charging-mat-are-gone%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) charging mat on its website — presumably, discontinuing these products is easier than upgrading them to USB-C.

 Apple is ditching the Lightning connector, but it isn't a voluntary choice. The company is acting in compliance with [upcoming EU regulations](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/step-by-step-tips-on-how-to-get-your-playstation-5-controller-to-charge-properly-again/), which mandate the use of USB-C in most small electronic devices. By enforcing USB-C adoption, the EU expects to reduce electronic waste and help people save money. These regulations will be enforced at the end of 2024, meaning that Apple has just a little over a year to deploy USB-C versions of its products. Suffice to say, we won't be surprised if some products are temporarily or permanently discontinued.

 We don't know if the MagSafe Battery Pack or MagSafe Duo will return. But, realistically, these products were overpriced and kind of lackluster. The MagSafe Battery Pack, which has a paltry 1,460mAh capacity, launched at $100 — twice the price of some [third-party MagSafe batteries](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-pinnacle-7-action-shooter-games/), and _several_ times the price of equivalent non-MagSafe batteries. As _9to5Mac_ notes, the MagSafe Battery Pack is also a bit awkward when paired with a large iPhone Plus or iPhone Pro Max.

 The MagSafe Duo mat faced far less criticism than Apple's MagSafe Battery Pack. Still, it was a very expensive charging solution at $130, and it faced stiff competition from both cheap and expensive alternatives. Some people opted for the [$40 knockoffs](https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Wireless-Charger-iPhone-Charging/dp/B0BHHRL8Z1/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000313&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fapples-magsafe-battery-and-magsafe-duo-charging-mat-are-gone%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) on Amazon, while others preferred the premium [Nomad Base One Max](https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-reviewing-ion-air-pro-3-capturing-life-in-high-definition/). And, of course, some people realized that they could just use separate chargers for their iPhone and Apple Watch.

 You can still buy the [MagSafe Battery Pack](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MJWY3AM-A-MagSafe-Battery/dp/B099BWY7WT/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000313&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fapples-magsafe-battery-and-magsafe-duo-charging-mat-are-gone%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) and [MagSafe Duo](http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXF3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08MWR2NXZ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000313&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fapples-magsafe-battery-and-magsafe-duo-charging-mat-are-gone%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) at some retailers, including Amazon. But these items may go out of stock soon, especially as some Apple enthusiasts clamor to secure the final Lightning accessories. For what it's worth, Apple may offer new MagSafe batteries and charging mats in the future — the company hasn't shared its plans.

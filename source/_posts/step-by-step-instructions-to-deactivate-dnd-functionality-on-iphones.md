[Using Control Center](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-gif-galore-converting-tweet-videos-at-zero-cost/) is the quickest way to turn off Do Not Disturb mode on your iPhone.

 To open Control Center on an iPhone X or later, swipe down from the top-right corner of your phone's screen. On other iPhone models, swipe up from the bottom of your phone's screen.

 When Control Center opens, tap the "Focus" option.

##  Customize iPhone's Do Not Disturb Mode From Settings

 You used to be able to deactivate Do Not Disturb [within the Settings App](https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-avoid-breaches-the-pre-upload-guide-to-copyright-on-tiktok/), however that option has been removed starting with the introduction of [Focus](https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-designing-distinctive-denouements/) in iOS 15\.

##  Bonus Tip: Turn Off Scheduled Do Not Disturb Mode on iPhone

 If you've [enabled a scheduled Do Not Disturb mode](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/exploring-the-top-hashtags-for-a-boost-on-ig-for-2024/), your iPhone will automatically enable the mode at the specified times. If you don't want that to happen, turn off the scheduled DND option.

 Open the Settings app on your iPhone and tap "Do Not Disturb."

 Scroll down to the "Set a Schedule" section on the "Do Not Disturb" page. Do Not Disturb can be triggered by a time schedule, your physical location, or when you're using a particular app. Tap the scheduled time, then toggle off the "Scheduled" option.

 From now on, your iPhone won't automatically turn on DND mode. You're all set.

## Affordable Apple Watch Series 8: High Performance on a Modest Spending Plan

Save big on the Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch SE, and prepare yourself for some of the best smartwatch experiences around.

 With springtime right around the corner, you may be thinking of getting outside more. Warmer weather means more reasons to go out for fun and fitness, so why not prepare for the great outdoors with a great smartwatch?

 Smartwatches are far more useful than just tracking your steps and phone notifications. The [best smartwatches](https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/can-i-use-itools-gpx-file-to-catch-the-rare-pokemon-on-poco-f5-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) will offer ways to keep you informed on your general health, including notifying you if your heart rate is too high or low. In addition, some will keep track of your location, which is great if you want to leave your phone in the car, and it can be a lifesaver if you get lost on a hike.

 The problem is that smartwatches are expensive—but now is also a perfect time to pick one up, after the New Year's Resolution rush. Right now, you can save $200 on the [Apple Watch Series 8](https://sovrn.co/1heueb0) at Walmart, which brings the popular smartwatch's price down to just $229.

 The Series 8 is not the latest of the [Apple Watch](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-capture-with-clarity-advanced-tips-for-gopro-hero5-black/) models—that honor goes to the Apple Watch Series 9 and the [Apple Watch Ultra 2](https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-mastering-your-youtube-pinpointing-a-specialized-audience/)—but the Series 8 is still [an incredible smartwatch](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/voice-recording-mastery-with-ipad-tools/) on its own. You'll get the standard step counters, sleep tracking, and notifications, but you'll also get nifty features like a blood oxygen sensor and Crash Detection. Apple products also tend to have a longer shelf life than their Android counterparts, so you know you won't need to update this Apple Watch anytime soon.

[$229 at Walmart](https://sovrn.co/1heueb0) 

 This price point brings the former flagship Apple Watch down to a price comparable to the [Apple Watch SE](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Midnight-Aluminum-Detection/dp/B0CHX9CY7W?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002151&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fapple-watch-8-deal%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), the company's more [budget-friendly smartwatch](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-deciphering-the-disappearance-of-recommended-video-content-in-your-newsfeed/). But if the $229 sales price is still (understandably) too high, the SE is also on sale! If you pick up this smartwatch up on Amazon, you'll save $60, bringing the total down to $189\. While the Apple Watch SE is [missing some features from the main series line](https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-contacts-from-oppo-a18-to-other-android-devices-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/), important features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS are still available.

#####  Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen, 40mm)

$189 $249 Save $60 

Looking to dip your toes in the world of smartwatches without spending too much, the Apple Watch SE is a perfect starting point. At under $200, it's even better!

[$189 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Midnight-Aluminum-Detection/dp/B0CHX9CY7W?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002151&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fapple-watch-8-deal%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) 

 The only catch with the Apple Watch line? You do need an [iPhone](https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-quick-vimeo-transformation-tips-easy-to-create-gifs/) to sync with the smartwatch. If you're a diehard Android fan, you'll need to [look into other smartwatches](https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-pedagogic-practices-with-a-focus-on-visual-materials/) and find the one that's best for you.

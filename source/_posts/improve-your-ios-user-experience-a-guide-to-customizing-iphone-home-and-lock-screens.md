### Tip 1\. The Size of the SIM Card

 SIM card on iPhone has different sizes, and before you remove or insert them, you must first identify them. So, if you want to know it better, you can read the information we have added here and the versions of the iPhone card supported.

1\. Standard Sim

 Standard SIM is the original SIM card size usually used on the old iPhone and other mobile devices. It measures approximately 25mm x 15mm.

2\. Micro Sim

 Micro SIM is the smaller version of the Standard SIM since its measures about 15mm x 12mm. iPhone 4 uses this type of SIM and is still used by most older phones and other devices.

3\. Nano Sim

 Nano SIM is the smallest SIM card size currently used by many updated devices. It measures approximately 12.3mm x 8.8mm, the standard SIM size for iPhone 5 and newer.

Though you can not remove the eSIM on your device, you can still reprogram it with different profiles or plans without swapping needs.

Its design may vary, but its purpose is similar for Android or iPhone devices. The ejector is a thin, metal tool with a small rounded tip that you will use to insert on the tray ejector hole, and the other end is a loop or handle.

##  What to Look For in an iPhone 15 Plus Case in 2023

 The design differences between the iPhone 14 Plus and iPhone 15 Plus aren’t huge, so you may be tempted to try to reuse your old case. While the old case may somewhat fit, the new model is slightly smaller, so you won’t get a good fit. You also can’t guarantee the buttons will line up, so you’ll want to spring for a new case.

 One of the most important decisions to make when buying a case is the form factor, as this can heavily affect the day-to-day usability of your phone. For example, a slim case doesn’t offer the most protection but makes for an easier fit in your pocket. Folio-style cases offer additional screen protection, as well as letting you prop your phone up like a tablet for watching videos.

 You’ll also want to think about the material your case uses. If you’re just thinking about protection, [thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-steamvr-issues-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide/) offers plenty of resistance against damage from drops, but doesn’t look great. Plastic composite offers more protection, while other materials like leather offer a balance between protection and aesthetics.

 Where and how you use your phone also deserves a fair amount of consideration, as while every case offers protection compared to no case at all, they’re not all built equal. If you’re frequently taking your phone to places most other people wouldn’t dare, you may want to consider a rugged case. These are bulkier but offer more layers of protection to keep your phone extra safe.

 Of course, which case you buy also depends on how much you want to spend. While you can easily spend upwards of $50 on a case, you don’t have to. Affordable cases can still offer plenty of protection; you’ll just want to make sure you’re buying from a well-known and trusted brand.

 Finally, think about the type of look you’re going for. A clear case gives you a look at your phone’s finish while offering protection. On the other hand, some cases let you add an entirely different style to your phone, depending on what you’re looking for.

Spigen

| Pros                                       | Cons                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Offers excellent protection                | Can't see the phone itself |
| MagSafe and wireless charging capabilities | Only two color options     |
| Inexpensive                                |                            |

 When it comes to a good case, you generally want something that protects your phone without being too bulky or getting in the way of other features. The [Spigen Mag Armor MagFit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5S8ZN83?th=1&tag=htg-v2-1g6qf4u-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000392&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) manages to balance this well while also being inexpensive.

 This case, made from TPU, also has Spigen's Air Cushion technology built-in. This helps the case absorb shocks from falls, so the iPhone 15 Pro doesn't get damaged. There is also a textured back to help you hold on to the phone, so you don't drop it in the first place.

 A case like the Mag Armor doesn't always have MagSafe compatibility, but Spigen has installed magnets so that you can use MagSafe wireless chargers and other accessories.

 All in all, Spigen has made a great case, but the Mag Armor MagFit only comes in two colors—[Matte Black](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5S8RMJ7?th=1&tag=htg-v2-1g6qf4u-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000392&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [Navy Blue](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5S8ZN83?th=1&tag=htg-v2-1g6qf4u-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000392&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Since there's no transparent option, you can't see the finish on your shiny new iPhone. But if this isn't a dealbreaker, it'll be hard to find anything better.

 You may think that buying a budget case means opting for less protection from drops, but fortunately, the materials that protect from drops aren’t that expensive. That means that when you opt for an affordable case like the [Spigen Ultra Hybrid Case](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5S87YGY/?tag=htg-v2-1g6qf4u-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000392&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), you’re not gambling with your iPhone’s life.

 Despite the price, the Spigen Ultra Hybrid doesn’t skimp on protection. Your phone is wrapped in a TPU bumper, which not only protects from drops but also protects your screen with a raised bevel. You also get a plastic composite back, adding to the case's durability. The case features built-in buttons to make using your phone while it’s in the case even easier.

 The Ultra Hybrid is also a great option if you’re looking for a clear case on a budget, as it comes in both [Crystal Clear](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5S8XP72/?tag=htg-v2-1g6qf4u-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000392&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [Frost Clear](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5S87XZN/?tag=htg-v2-1g6qf4u-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000392&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) options.

 The Scooch case is made from TPU and uses a hidden wallet design, meaning that the case looks more like a slightly bulky, rugged case rather than a full wallet design. This hides anywhere from three to five cards, depending on thickness. That said, do keep in mind that the case doesn’t have an area for carrying cash, so this may be a problem.

 The hidden card slot also features as a kickstand for your iPhone 15 Plus, letting you easily stand it up on end.

 A rugged case needs to keep your phone safe in conditions where your average case may fail. Of course, ensuring you keep a solid grip on your phone can prevent you from dropping it in the first place, which is also important. The [Smartish Gripzilla iPhone 15 Plus Protective Case](https://www.amazon.com/Smartish-iPhone-15-Plus-MagSafe-Protective-Grip-Shockproof-Case/dp/B0C7HK1XKC/?tag=htg-v2-1g6qf4u-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000392&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) does both.

 The Gripzilla offers shock-absorbing air pockets on the corners, and Smartish has successfully drop-tested the case 50 times from six feet, falling directly onto concrete. The case also features camera and screen protection via bezels, helping to keep your glass unscratched. The finger grooves on the side add plenty of extra grip, helping you keep a handle on your phone.

 The case features support for wireless charging and MagSafe.

 If you just bought a brand new iPhone 15 Plus, the idea of covering up its colorful finish may not be ideal, but at the same time, you don’t want to damage it. Clear cases are perfect for this situation, protecting your phone without covering it up, and the [Spigen Ultra Hybrid S MagFit Designed for iPhone 15 Plus](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Anti-Yellowing-Military-Grade-Protection-Compatible/dp/B0C5S9FBDH/?tag=htg-v2-1g6qf4u-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000392&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) also has a few cool extras.

 The Ultra Hybrid S uses a mix of TPU and plastic composite, with the bulk of the case made from soft, protective TPU. While clear cases are known for going yellow over time, Spigen uses a blue resin in the TPU to prevent this from developing. You also get a built-in kickstand, letting you prop up your iPhone for voice calls or videos.

 Most clear cases sold by companies besides Apple don’t feature MagSafe, but this one does. It also supports Qi wireless charging, so you can charge your phone however you like.

 Cases do a great job of protecting your phone, but by design, they add a certain amount of bulk. That said, if you don’t need maximum protection, you can get by with a thinner case. The [TORRAS Magnetic for iPhone 15 Plus Case](https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-iPhone-14-Plus-Translucent/dp/B0B8HRNSBC/?tag=htg-v2-1g6qf4u-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000392&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-iphone-15-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offers solid protection, a great look, and plenty of extra features to make your phone more useful.

 Don’t let the thin build fool you—while this case doesn’t add much heft to your phone, it adds significant protection. This case uses a TPU material in a four-ply structure with bezels around the screen and camera to protect your glass. The case also uses a soft coating on the outside to ensure you don’t lose grip.

 The case supports MagSafe accessories and Qi wireless charging and features detachable tri-color buttons.

 As great as Apple’s FineWoven cases are, if you miss leather, no sort of other material is going to fill that void. Fortunately, plenty of other manufacturers still make leather cases, and some do a fantastic job. For proof, look no further than the [Nomad Modern Leather Folio](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2000392%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fmodern-leather-folio-black-iphone-15-plus) case for iPhone 15 Plus.

 With many leather case options, you don’t know what you’re getting. Nomad, on the other hand, gets its full-grain, sustainably sourced leather from the Danish leather tannery [Ecco](https://eccoleather.com/home). While cheaper leather cases may fall apart over time, this leather will form a patina over time, eventually giving you a case that looks wholly unique.

 While made of leather, this case also features a TPU interior for extra protection and is MagSafe compatible.

## FAQ

### Can I use my iPhone 14 Plus case with the iPhone 15 Plus?

 No. While you may be able to fit an iPhone 15 Plus into a case designed for the iPhone 14 Plus, the newer model is smaller overall (albeit by fractions of a millimeter) and shaped slightly differently, so you won’t get a perfect fit.

### Can I use an iPhone 15 Pro Max case with the iPhone 15 Plus?

 No. Despite the name, the overall size of the iPhone 15 Pro Max is just a bit smaller than the iPhone 15 Plus, and it has a larger camera array on the back, so the cases aren’t interchangeable.

### Can I use a Lightning cable with my iPhone 15?

 No. All iPhone 15 models use a USB-C connection instead of Lightning. While the cables don’t work, you should be able to use your old charger with a USB-C cable.

### Will an iPhone 15 Plus case protect the screen?

 Sometimes. Many (but not all) iPhone 15 Plus cases feature raised bezels around the screen and camera to protect the glass. To further protect your screen, you can use a tempered glass screen protector.

### Does the iPhone 15 use a USB-C cable for charging?

 Yes. All iPhone 15 models use USB-C, unlike older models that use a Lightning connector.

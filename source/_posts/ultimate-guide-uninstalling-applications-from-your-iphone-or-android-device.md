 Before deleting apps on iPhone/Android, we'd like to warmly point out not every iOS/Android app can be easily deleted or uninstalled. For Android mobile phone, some default or downloaded applications have been rooted, so you have no permission to directly uninstall them. For some iOS apps, you may need to jailbreak your device and get the authority to remove the apps. Manufacturers previously choose what apps have been preinstalled. When you try to delete an app on iPhone or Android, the device will simply prompt you whether the app can be disabled or uninstalled.

## Part 2\. How to uninstall/disable unwanted apps on Android phone

### Uninstall vs. disable

 There are two ways for you to delete apps. It is up to whether the app came preinstalled or you downloaded it from app store on you Android phone/tablet.

#### Uninstall downloaded apps

 You can easily and completely delete an app on Android device if you downloaded it from Google Play or from other app stores.

#### Disable preinstalled apps

 Manufacturers previously choose what apps have been preinstalled. You can disable them, but you can do nothing to directly delete these apps. When you disable preinstalled applications, they will be hidden on your Android phone/tablet. If you really want to erase these preinstalled apps, you must[root the Android device](https://tools.techidaily.com/) and get the authority. Kindly note that most preinstalled apps may be associated with the system. If you forcibly remove them, some functions may not work smoothly.

### How to delete Android apps from settings

![Delete Apps from Android Settings](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/resource/delete-apps/delete-apps-on-android-settings.jpg)

Step 1 Navigate to "Settings", scroll down the screen and find "Apps" or "Application manager".

Step 2 Then you can find applications available on your phone, listed as downloaded apps, SD card apps, and all apps.

Step 3 Tap the app and enter "App info" screen. Choose "Uninstall" or "Disable" option.

Notes : For mobile phone/tablet running Android 4.4 KitKat, when you need to disable preinstalled apps, select "Force Stop" and then tap "Disable". This won't let you completely delete the app, but you'll find it will never run again on your Android device until you restore Android to factory settings.

### How to delete apps from app menu

 For some Android phones like Samsung's Galaxy range, you might delete apps from the homescreen app menu. You can long press the app until it is marked with a cross or a minus. Tap the mark and then uninstall the unwanted app. For some Android device like LG phone, you can also long press the non-rooted app and drag it to the top "App info", and then it will offer "uninstall" option.

## Enjoy Complimentary Apple Products with Your Target Rewards – Claim Now!

Target offers a variety of free trials on Apple services, and you can take advantage of them even if you've redeemed a free trial in the past.

 Who doesn't love free trials? Thanks to Target, you can get [up to three free months of the most popular Apple services](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Ftarget-and-apple-services%2F-%2FN-upiav). The only catch is that you need to be a Target Circle member, but you can [sign up for free](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fl%2Ftarget-circle%2F-%2FN-pzno9).

 Target includes a whole slew of services, so here is the rundown of each service and how many free months you get:

* [Apple TV+ for 3 months](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fcircle%2Fpartners%2F3002)
* [MLS Season Pass for 1 month](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fcircle%2Fpartners%2F3006)
* [Apple Fitness+ for 3 months](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fcircle%2Fpartners%2F3004)
* [Apple Arcade for 3 months](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fcircle%2Fpartners%2F3000)
* [iCloud+ for 3 months](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fcircle%2Fpartners%2F3003)
* [Apple Music for 2 months](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fcircle%2Fpartners%2F3001)

 Just make sure to hit 'Redeem now' on the store page, and Target will email you a code for the trial, which won't expire until February 2025 at the time of writing.

 This isn't actually a new promotion, as Target has had these trials for a while, but some points make this deal especially noteworthy now. First, with the [Target Circle Week sale](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-the-vloggers-guide-to-choosing-camgear-the-top-9-innovations/), you can save on [a whole slew of Apple products](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Felectronics-deals%2F-%2FN-556x9Z5y3ejZpb345%3Ftype%3Dproducts), so getting free trials for popular Apple services is a great bonus. My personal recommendations are the [iPad mini](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-2021-6th-generation%2F-%2FA-84619867%3Fpreselect%3D77615852%23lnk%3Dsametab), on sale for $399.99, and the [Apple Watch Series 9](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-9-gps-aluminum-case-with-sport-band%2F-%2FA-89957956%3Fpreselect%3D85966245%23lnk%3Dsametab), on sale for $349.99.

 Additionally, these free trials are separate from the trials you get from buying Apple products themselves. While this may not sound like a positive—free trials don't stack, after all—you can use the trial you get from the Apple product, let it run out, then redeem the Target code and get another trial.

 As long as you don't have an active trial or subscription, you can apply the code and enjoy more free time. I just tried this myself to confirm, and I was able to redeem another three months of Apple TV+, even though I'd already used a trial in the past.

 So go ahead![Sign up for Target Circle](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fl%2Ftarget-circle%2F-%2FN-pzno9), [grab your codes](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Ftarget-and-apple-services%2F-%2FN-upiav), and enjoy your free subscriptions.

 Available in Polar White and Midnight Black colors, the Infinacore T3 is designed to be folded up or unfurled—accordion style. When collapsed, the charging station is only 1.2 inches thick, and .4 inches when expanded.

 From left to right, the three plastic panels include a 15W MagSafe charging dock for iPhones, a foldout 3W Apple Watch dock and LED toggle, and a 5W charging pad designed for AirPods. The three panels are all connected with magnetized silicone hinges that make folding and unfolding quick and easy.

 When you flip the charging station over, you’ll find a QR code for customer support, along with the model and serial number.

 A single 25W USB-C input is the only port you’ll find on this device. Besides the charging station itself, the only other item in the box is a USB-C cable. Unfortunately, you’ll need to provide your own power adapter.

##  Other Features: A Triangular Podium in Disguise

 Two of my favorite features of the Infinacore T3 are its LED charging indicators and triangular configuration option.

 As to the former, you’ll find integrated LEDs on each charging panel. When your iPhone, Apple Watch, or AirPods are docked, status lights (green, yellow, and red) give you a quick battery life readout for each of your devices. If you’re not into the illumination, just press the toggle button on the Apple Watch charging pad square.

 In terms of layout, I really liked that you can fold out the panels in a triangular formation. Doing so gives you a built-in kickstand for your iPhone, that supports both vertical and horizontal positioning. I also appreciated that even when the charger is folded up, the iPhone charging pad is still accessible.

##  Using the Infinacore T3: Excellent for Mobile Tech

 Whenever I review a [wireless charger](https://howto.techidaily.com/full-solutions-to-fix-error-code-920-in-google-play-on-nokia-130-music-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), one of the first things I pay attention to is how warm the charger and the devices I’m charging get. I’m delighted to say that I didn’t have any “Wow, my iPhone is hot” moments when testing the Infinacore T3.

 I thought the T3 did a terrific job at charging my iPhone. In a few different tests, I was able to add around 30% more battery in just over half an hour.

 I frequently used the iPhone and AirPods charging pads at the same time. While trickle-down charging is more of a wired charging station feature, I thought the Infinacore T3 did a nice job at allocating power to the devices that needed it most.

 Accordion-style [charging stations](https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-quicksilver-chords-shorts-actor-melodies/) are made by several companies, with the [Mophie 3-in-1 Travel Charger](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-cost-free-cgi-mastery-via-4-youtube-experts-insights-for-2024/) being another solid example of this convenient design. Cost-wise though, the Infinacore T3 has it beat. I also prefer the plastic-and-silicone housing over the Mophie's fabric body, which has a nasty habit of collecting dust and debris.

##  Should You Buy the Infinacore T3 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station?

 The [Infinacore T3 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station](https://www.amazon.com/InfinaCore-Tri-Charge-Wireless-Charging-Travel-Friendly/dp/B0CNF88S1F?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001760&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Finfinacore-t3-3-in-1-wireless-charging-station-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is a portable and cost-efficient wireless charging station that I wouldn't think twice about buying. When unfolded, it doesn't take up much space either, and the built-in LED status lights are a great way to monitor the battery life of your mobile devices.

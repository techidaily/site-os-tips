 As we did some research, there are seven reasons why my messages are not sending, and we have listed them below for you to read. Knowing the problem can hint at what solution we should use to fix it.

### 1\. Internet or Signal Problem

 One of the main culprits, why messages are failing to be sent is an internet or signal problem.

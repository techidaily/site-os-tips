 Remove the screws on the bracket and then gently remove the bracket. You'd better take iPhone screen off before you remove the bracket.

5 Eject iPhone battery

![Make iPhone 6 Battery Replacement](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/solution/iphone-battery-replacement/replace-iphone6-battery.jpg)

 iPhone 6 uses much glue to fix the battery, so it's not easy to remove it. You can directly use crowbar to take battery off. But we suggest you use hair dryer to warm the rear cover first, then you can easily remove the iPhone battery.

6 Put in the new battery

 Put the new battery back in and reconnect the cable with the opening tool. If you are worried about the glue isn't enough, you can put some double-sided tape to the battery.

Step 7 Assemble iPhone screen

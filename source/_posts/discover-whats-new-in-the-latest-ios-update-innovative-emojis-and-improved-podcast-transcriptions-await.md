## Discover What's New in the Latest iOS Update – Innovative Emojis and Improved Podcast Transcriptions Await!

Apple released iOS 17 for iPhones and iPadOS 17 for iPads last year, complete with new iMessage features, custom lock screens for iPads, a Journal app, StandBy Mode on MagSafe charging stands, and other helpful features. There have been a few minor updates since then, and now version 17.4 is rolling out.

 The iOS 17.4 update for iPhones is a massive overhaul, but [only in the European Union](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/the-final-cut-editors-toolkit-10-plugin-winners/), where Apple must now allow alternative app marketplaces (e.g. third-party app stores like [SetApp](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-access-your-apple-iphone-15-when-you-forget-the-passcode-drfone-by-drfone-ios/)), third-party web browsers with their own rendering engines, and easier choice in changing the default Safari browser. Those new features will only work for iPhones within EU borders, though, because Apple hasn’t been legally compelled to roll out similar functionality in other countries (yet).

 Besides the geo-restricted features, iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 add support for automatic transcriptions in Apple Podcasts. When you’re playing an episode, there’s a button to show a transcript that is highlighted with the current spoken section, and you can search the entire text for specific phrases. Podcasts hosted on Spotify and YouTube have a similar feature.

 The update also adds new emoji: a mushroom, phoenix, broken chain, and shaking heads. There are also 18 new people and body emoji, with the option to face left or right. The full list of changes for iPhones and iPads are listed below.

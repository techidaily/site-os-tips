## Transform Your Browsing with Vivaldi for iPhone/iPad - Unveiling Stylish Themes & Powerful Dark Mode Options

Vivaldi on iPhone and iPad just added a bevy of new theming options. You can now choose custom accent colors for the browser, set a custom background for your Start Page, or force web pages to load in dark mode. These changes require [Vivaldi 6.6](http://vivaldi.com/blog/vivaldi-on-ios-6-6/) or a later release.

 To customize your theme in Vivaldi 6.6, open the browser's Settings and head to "Appearance & Theme." Vivaldi will give you a collection of preset colors, though you're free to choose custom colors from a palette, color spectrum graph, or color slider. Accent colors affect several components of the Vivaldi interface, including the address bar and tab menu. If necessary, you can enter the HEX codes for custom colors.

 There's also an option to "inherit accent color from web page." With this option enabled, Vivaldi's accent color will match whatever website you have open. Safari introduced a similar option in 2021, and in my experience, it can make web pages feel much more polished and modern. Just know that most websites use a subdued color scheme. You'll usually end up with gray, white, or navy accent colors.

 Theming options extend to the Vivaldi Start Page, which now supports custom wallpaper images and a "Speed Dial" bookmark system. It's similar to the start page on the Firefox or Safari mobile browsers. If wallpapers aren't your style, you can choose a solid-colored background instead.

 And, if you're a dark mode user, you can now go _even darker_. Vivaldi on iOS has added an option to force dark mode on all web pages. This option, which is available on most mobile browsers, automatically generates dark theming for web pages and will work perfectly most of the time. If you need to quickly disable dark mode theming on a website, you can do so from a checkbox in the main Vivaldi menu.

 Along with these new theming options, Vivaldi says that it has improved the speed and stability of its iOS browser by better optimizing the ad blocker. Vivaldi has also made it easier to open and share links from background tabs. A full [changelog](https://vivaldi.com/blog/vivaldi-on-ios-6-6/) is available on the Vivaldi blog.

 Download the [Vivaldi 6.6](http://apps.apple.com/us/app/vivaldi-powerful-web-browser/id1633234600) update to unlock these new features on iOS. Note that Vivaldi already supports custom theming and dark mode [on Android](https://help.vivaldi.com/android/android-appearance/themes-on-android/).

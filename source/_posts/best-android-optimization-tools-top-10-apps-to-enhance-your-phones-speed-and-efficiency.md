## Part 1\. What to do with cracked phone screen?

 If you've got a broken phone screen, first you should assess how bad the damage is. You might be able to live with small cracks that don't block your view too much, but larger cracks should probably be dealt with immediately. For example, if the colors on your screen are abnormal or some pixels are no longer displaying, the damage has gone much further than the glass on top and has affected the LCD panel beneath.

 If you cannot live with a broken phone screen and decide to repair it, there are two methods you can try.

### Method 1\. DIY: Fix a cracked phone screen at home

 The cheapest way to[fix your broken screen phone](https://tools.techidaily.com/) is by yourself at home.

 You can buy the Android or iPhone screen from eBay, Amazon, and other sites. Also, make sure you buy the tools to complete the replacement, and follow the online guide to fix the broken screen. Still there are some guides that tell you to fix the phone screen with toothpaste.

![Fix Broken Screen DIY](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/article/broken-screen/diy-fix-broken-phone.jpg)

 Of course, not all of us have the skills or time to fix broken phone screen. When you decide to repair screen in this way, you must be aware that you may get your broken screen phone to brick. If you can take that risk, move one…

### Method 2\. Get the mobile provider/phone manufacturer to fix cracked phone screen

 If you cracked your phone screen during your manufacturer's warranty period, you should be able to get it fixed for free and within a few hours' time. (Bear in mind, though, that the standard limited warranties of many manufacturers, such as Samsung, do not cover accidents.) Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost upwards of $100.

 Otherwise, a quick Internet search should give you a list of phone screen repair stores around your area. Just make sure your phone is protected by a password before you hand it off to a stranger.

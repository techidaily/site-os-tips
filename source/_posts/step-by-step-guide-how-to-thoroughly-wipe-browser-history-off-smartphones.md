## Part 3\. FAQs of Making iPhone Faster

 The reason why your iPhone is slow is mainly that there is not enough space on your device. You may encounter all kinds of problems such as lagging iPhone, stuck iPhone and crashes. In this situation, you need to clean up your iPhone storage space.

2\. Do iPhones get slower over time?

 Absolutely yes. Not only iPhone, but almost all electronic devices get slower over time. So, you'd better upgrade it to a new one when the iPhone cannot work functionally.

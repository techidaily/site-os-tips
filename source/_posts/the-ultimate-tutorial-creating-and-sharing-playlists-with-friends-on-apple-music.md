![Playlist sharing option in the Apple Music app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/playlist-sharing-option-in-the-apple-music-app.jpg) 

 That's it! Your friends can either join the playlist directly by tapping on the playlist or request access, depending on whether you turned on "Approve Collaborators."

##  How to Manage Collaborators on Apple Music

 If you've enabled the "Approve Collaborators" toggle, your friends will see a "Request to Join" option when they open your playlist invitation. You'll need to manually accept the request for your friend to join the playlist.

![Request to join option to join the playlist.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/request-to-join-option-to-join-the-playlist.jpg) 

 To accept the request, tap the Library icon, select the "Playlist" option, and then open the relevant playlist.

 Similarly, your collaborators can also add songs to the playlist. You'll see your collaborators' profile icon on the songs they've added.

![Collaborator profile icon next to a song in a collaborative playlist.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/collaborator-profile-icon-on-the-song.jpg)

##  How to Stop Collaborating or Leave a Collaborative Playlist

 You might run into a situation where you don't want your collaborators to add more songs or edit the ones already in the playlist. In that case, you'll need to stop the collaboration. To do this, open the playlist, tap the collaborator icon, and select the "Stop" button next to Collaboration.

##  What You Need to Use Collaborative Playlists on Apple Music

 There are two requirements to use collaborative playlists on Apple Music. First, you must ensure your iPhone is running on iOS 17.3 or later. To check the iOS version, open the Settings app, tap "General," and then select "Software Update." You must [update your iPhone](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-premium-webcam-guide-5-best-options-with-mic-integration/) if the iOS version is 17.2 or earlier.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 The other requirement is an active [Apple Music](https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/most-asked-questions-about-pokemon-go-battle-league-rewards-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) subscription. To check if you have an Apple Music subscription, open the Settings app and tap your name at the top.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Select "Subscriptions." Then, under the Active section, check if Apple Music is listed. If yes, then it means you have an active Apple Music subscription. You'll have to [purchase Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/) if you don't have a subscription.

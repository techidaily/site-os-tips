## Part 4 . How to Backup iPhone to Computer with Google Drive

 You can also backup iPhone to PC with the help of Google Drive, thus you are able to access iPhone data through Google on PC. But like iTunes, Google Drive will fullly backup your iPhone data. Your iPhone emails, calendars and contacts have been online already.

Step 1 Run Google Drive on your iPhone

 Connect to a Wi-Fi network. Download and install Google Drive from App Store on your iPhone. Now you are able to backup iPhone without a computer. Choose "Menu" icon in its left panel.

Step 2 Use Google Drive to backup content on your iPhone

 Click "Settings" gear icon from the top. Select "Backup" and choose the file type you want to make a backup including "Photos & Videos". Tap on "Start Backup" button and back up now.

 If you need to backup lots of photos from iPhone to Google Drive, this way will not work well, as only new photos will be backed up. And Google Drive will overwrite your precious backup files like iTunes does, including other data such as contacts and calendars.

##  What to Look for in an iPhone Charger in 2024

 It's easy to assume that many wall adapters and Lightning cables are the same—they look and work the same way, after all. However, you should pay attention to the quality of the cords and wall chargers you're buying since they can affect the performance of your iPhone's battery over time.

 The biggest thing to look out for in an iPhone charger is the charging speed. Both wired and wireless charging vary in performance, with most iPhones charging at around 20W over a cable and 7.5W wirelessly via Qi technology.

 Apple's new [MagSafe](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/mastering-regional-adjustments-how-to-update-regions-on-your-iphone/) also has a charging speed standard of 15W. It's the fastest way to wirelessly charge your iPhone, assuming you have a MagSafe-certified charger on hand.

 It's also helpful to pay attention to the quality of the cables and adapters you buy, as it can make a huge difference in the long run. Some companies offer braided cables that are less likely to get damaged over time, while other companies have fast-charging wall adapters with compact designs.

 With your iPhone's charging speeds and other knowledge in mind, here are our iPhone charge recommendations.

| -------------------------------- | ----------------- |

 If you want a reliable wall charger for your iPhone, the [Spigen 30W USB-C Power Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Spigen-Foldable-Charging-Nintendo/dp/B08V5MC4KT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208428&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F759357%2Fbest-iphone-charger%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the way to go. This wall wart is capable of 30W charging speeds, over-accommodating for every iPhone currently available. It ships with a compact design and folding prongs, so it's easy to throw in a bag.

 The Spigen charger is a touch pricey at $25, but it's well worth it for the best charging speeds around.

 If you'd like to save a few dollars, [Apple's 20W USB-C Power Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208428&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F759357%2Fbest-iphone-charger%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a decent pick. It's designed specifically to charge your iPhone, and since it's straight from Apple, you're guaranteed optimal power management to help maintain your phone's battery health over time.

 It's not as fast as the [Spigen option](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-bypassing-google-account-with-vnrom-bypass-for-xiaomi-13t-pro-by-drfone-android/), which supports just 20W charging, and its design is a little dated. Regardless, if you want a charger you know will work as advertised, this might be the one for you.

 If you need a good, reliable wireless charger, look no further than [Belkin's Wireless Charging Stand](https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Wireless-Charger-Qi-Certified-Compatibility/dp/B096L8CY62?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208428&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F759357%2Fbest-iphone-charger%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Priced at $25, this wireless charger supports any device with Qi wireless charging at up to 15W of charging speed. With the iPhone, you'll get the full 7.5W Apple allows.

 It isn't the most flashy-looking wireless charger, but when it comes to functionality, it works well, especially since it doubles as a phone stand. You can't beat that price, either!

| Pros                          | Cons                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Braided, durable design     | ✗ A bit more expensive than other cables |
| ✓ Three colors to choose from |                                          |

 Braided cables are better than non-braided ones—it's as simple as that. They're less likely to be damaged over time, so it's worth going for braided when you're purchasing any sort of phone charger cable. [Anker's New Nylon USB-C to Lightning Cable](https://www.amazon.com/Lightning-Anker-Charging-Certified-Supports/dp/B07XYSVFBM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208428&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F759357%2Fbest-iphone-charger%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is one of the best braided cables on the market with its premium and durable design.

 Offered in three colors, the cable is [Made for iPhone (MFi) certified](https://mfi.apple.com/) and can achieve the fastest charging speeds your iPhone supports. Plus, it's affordable at just $18 MSRP. That's slightly more expensive than other cables, but the extra few dollars are worth it.

 Picking up the [iPhone 15](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15)? Grab a [Lightning to USB-C adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Powerline-Lightning-Probably-Certified/dp/B07HVBYDYY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208428&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F759357%2Fbest-iphone-charger%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) so you don't need to buy new cables!

### Why isn't my iPhone charging?

 If you're charging wirelessly, make sure that your phone is correctly oriented on the charger or that your MagSafe charger is properly attached. If you're charging via the charging port, try cleaning your charging port.

### How do I clean the iPhone's charging port?

 First, power off your phone. Once it's off, you can use a wooden toothpick to clean out the port. Don't use anything metallic or compressed air. For more information, see our guide to cleaning your iPhone charging port.

### How do I dry the iPhone's charging port?

 Lightly tap your phone against your palm with the charging port facing down to remove excess water. Then leave your phone somewhere safe and dry for at least 30 minutes. After time has passed and the port appears dry, try connecting your charging cable.

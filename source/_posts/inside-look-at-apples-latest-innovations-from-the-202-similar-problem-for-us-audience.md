## Inside Look at Apple's Latest Innovations From the 202 # Similar Problem for U.S. Audience

Apple held its Worldwide Developers Conference earlier this week, revealing dozens of new features and changes coming to the iPhone, Mac, iPad, and other Apple devices. Here’s everything you might have missed.

 We got our first real look at the upcoming iOS 18, macOS Sequoia, iPadOS 18, visionOS 2, tvOS 18, and watchOS 11 updates this week. The big reveal was Apple Intelligence, the company’s long-awaited answer to the generative AI rush. Even though it looks more useful and more private than many other recent attempts at AI tools ([looking at you, Recall](https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-best-of-yt-a-deep-dive-into-music-dance-clips-23/)), it won’t even enter testing until later this year, so there are still some open questions.

##  The Big News

### [Here's How AI Will Transform the iPhone, iPad, and Mac This Fall](https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/investing-successfully-with-a-makeup-channel/) 

 Apple Intelligence is coming later this year, powering a revamped Siri and new writing and design tools.

##  Even More News

 The [Safari 18 update](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/macos-sequoia-takes-productivity-and-intelligence-on-mac-to-new-heights/#:~:text=next-,Big%20Updates%20Come%20to%20Safari,-Safari%2C%20the%20world%E2%80%99s) coming to macOS Sequoia, iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and visionOS 2 has a redesigned Reader mode, a one-click button to move web videos to a larger view, and (on supported devices) page summarization. Apple also published [a full technical changelog](https://webkit.org/blog/15443/news-from-wwdc24-webkit-in-safari-18-beta/) for the update, if you’re curious about the underlying engine changes.

 Apple also revealed how it trained its new artificial intelligence tools: by scraping the open web without asking for permission first, just like most other companies developing AI tools. [Not everyone is happy about that](https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/112609519691842609).

 Finally, Apple revealed the [visionOS 2 update](https://driver-error.techidaily.com/diagnosing-and-correcting-asus-windows-10-acpi-fails/), the [tvOS 18 update](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/updates-to-the-home-experience-elevate-entertainment-and-bring-more-convenience/) for Apple TV, support for [more hiking routes in Apple Maps](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/new-features-come-to-apple-services-this-fall/), and [new gestures for AirPods](https://nr.apple.com/dR5M1Y8hM2).

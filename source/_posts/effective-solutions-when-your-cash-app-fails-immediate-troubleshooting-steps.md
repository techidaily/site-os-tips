 Cash App is a popular app that allows you to send and receive money online, but it may not always work properly. There are few things as frustrating as trying to access or send money and not being able to do it. Thankfully, there are a number of easy fixes if Cash App is not working.

##  Restart the App

 The first thing you should always try when an Android or iPhone app is misbehaving is simply restarting it. On an iPhone or iPad, you can [fully close an app](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-next-gen-key-smartwatch-opens-your-mac/) by opening the multitasking app switcher and swiping Cash App up off the screen.

 Over on Android, you can do the exact same thing to perform a "soft" close [but to close the app fully](https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-expert-tips-on-ipad-screen-casts-for-2024/), you'll want to "Force Close" or "Force Stop" it. To do that, you'll need to dive into Settings > Apps > Cash App > Force Stop.

 With the Cash App closed, you can reopen it and see if the problem persists. If it does, keep reading.

##  Clear the App Cache and Data or Reinstall

 Restarting an app will only do exactly that—restart it—nothing will actually be changed in the app. To take things to the next level, we can clear the cache, data, or reinstall the Cash App. On Android, you can clear the cache and data, which is essentially the same as reinstalling the app. On iPhone, you'll need to uninstall and reinstall manually.

 You can [follow our full tutorial for clearing app cache on Android](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/elevate-your-mac-experience-with-these-5-snippers/). "Clear Cache" and "Clear Data" are always found in the same place. Clearing the cache removes temporary files that pile up, while clearing data will remove everything, including your accounts.

 To get the same effect on the iPhone, you'll need to [uninstall the app and reinstall it again](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-capturing-screens-a-laptops-webcam-journey/). This will remove everything as well.

##  Check for App Updates

 Another common cause of app-related problems is running outdated software. There may be an update for Cash App waiting in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store that will resolve the issues you're having. Thankfully, this is an easy fix.

 Essentially, you just need to open the [App Store on your iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cash-app/id711923939) or the [Play Store on your Android device](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2002214/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.squareup.cash&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) and search for "Cash App." Once you find the app info page, you'll either see a button for "Update," or there won't be one available.

 Check out our guides for [updating iPhone apps](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-sim-cards-of-xiaomi-redmi-note-13-pro-5g-without-puk-codes-by-drfone-android/) and [updating Android apps](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-here-are-some-reliable-ways-to-get-pokemon-go-friend-codes-for-meizu-21-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) for more information.

##  Try the Cash App Website

 If problems with the Cash App mobile apps persist, you can try bypassing them entirely and [using the Cash App website](https://cashapp.pxf.io/c/156932/971308/12855?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2002214&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fcash.app%2F). You can do all of the same things with the website as you can in the Android or iPhone app. However, if the problem lies with Cash App itself, the website likely won't work either, which leads to our next thing to try.

##  Check if Cash App is Down

 After everything we've tried, if nothing seems to be fixing the issues, it's possible that the Cash App service is down. This doesn't happen super often, but it's not uncommon. [Cash App has a handy page you can check](https://status.cash.app/) to see if any services are down. There won't be anything you can do to resolve the issues yourself, but at least you'll know it's not just you.

##  Contact Your Bank or Customer Support

 The last resort is to talk to an actual human being. You can [contact Cash App customer support](https://cashapp.pxf.io/c/156932/971308/12855?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2002214&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fcash.app%2Fcontact) or get in touch with the bank or credit card you have connected to your account. If you've tried everything in this list and the Cash App service is up and running, this is your last lifeline. Good luck!

##  How Does Back Tap Work on iPhones?

 Back Tap is an iOS accessibility feature that detects physical finger taps on the back of your iPhone using your phone's built-in accelerometer. It works on the iPhone 8 and newer iPhones. When configured in Settings, you can use two or three taps to [launch many different actions on your phone](https://ai-live-streaming.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-10-free-football-streaming-sites-to-bookmark/), including shortcuts, which is what we'll use here to turn on the flashlight.

 It used to be necessary to create a special flashlight shortcut to make this work, but no longer.

 In Settings, navigate to Accessibility > Touch.

![Scroll to the "Physical and Motor" section, then tap "Touch."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tap-touch-in-physical-and-motor.png) 

 In "Touch Settings," select "Back Tap." It is at the bottom of the page.

 In "Back Tap" settings, choose whether you'd like to activate your flashlight using two taps ("Double Tap") or three taps ("Triple Tap") on the back of your phone, then select the matching option.

![Select "Double Tap" or "Triple Tap."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tap-double-or-triple-tap.png) 

 Next, scroll down through the actions list until you see the Flashlight option. A blue checkmark will appear next to it once it is active.

![Select "Flashlight" in the tap menu. A blue check appears next to it when it is active.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/double-tap-flashlight-enabled.png) 

 Press back once to make sure the change is registered, then exit Settings.

 The next time you double or triple tap the back of your iPhone (depending on how you set it up), your iPhone flashlight will turn on. Tap the back two or three times again to turn it off. Have fun illuminating dark spaces!

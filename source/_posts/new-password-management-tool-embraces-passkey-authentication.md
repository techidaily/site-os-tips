## New Password Management Tool Embraces Passkey Authentication

Passkeys are the future of digital security. And [password managers](https://www.reviewgeek.com/37116/the-best-password-managers/) such as [1Password](https://www.reviewgeek.com/145292/1password-will-kill-the-last-password-you-needed/), [Dashlane](https://www.reviewgeek.com/128160/password-manager-dashlane-wants-to-usher-in-passwordless-era/), and LastPass have already announced support for the new technology. [NordPass joins that list](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU904875/https://nordpass.com/blog/what-is-a-passkey/) this week with Passkey support going live in its app.

 NordPass ([Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU904875/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nordpass.android.app.password.manager&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) and [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nordpass-password-manager/id1486322860)) explains that using Passkeys with its system is superior to using "alternative systems," because it allows for syncing between cross-platform devices, offers better passkey-sharing options, and grants instant portability between operating systems. This means that if you use multiple devices in different ecosystems, such as a Windows Laptop and an iPhone, you can use your Passkeys more easily.

 Passkeys are the 21st-century replacement for passwords. Instead of creating a different password for multiple accounts that you need to keep track of, remember, and change frequently, passkeys are all computer-generated, unique, and randomized and aren't susceptible to traditional hacking and phishing methods that [passwords are](https://www.reviewgeek.com/140954/the-lastpass-scandal-shows-its-time-to-leave-passwords-behind/). Also, passkeys utilize biometric data such as a face scan or fingerprint to verify a user's identity before logging into a site, service, or app.

 The FIDO Alliance, a consortium of major tech firms, has been [developing passwordless technology](https://www.reviewgeek.com/117029/google-apple-and-microsoft-agree-to-make-passwords-a-thing-of-the-past/) for several years. Its goal is to create a more secure way to log into their accounts that doesn't rely on human-generated content like passwords that can be guessed, hacked, or otherwise compromised.

## Part 3\. Tips: What Happens if I Clear Cache on iPad

 In reality, cache helps to find your interests when surfing the internet or using an app. But it can pile up, and the cache can be an issue for the device. When you observe your iPad acting up, clearing the cache is a recommended method to regulate the speed. But what really happens when deleting them from browsers and applications?

 A good choice of erasing the cache will bring your iPad to a tip-top shape. But this is what happens to an app you cleared: some settings will be deleted, but it will not sign you out from accounts and other credentials. For the browsers, it will remove your search histories, while for the apps, temporary files will be deleted. Don’t worry; these files can be obtained again as you continue to use the apps. Doing cache removal regularly is not only good for tech hygiene but also frees up more storage space.

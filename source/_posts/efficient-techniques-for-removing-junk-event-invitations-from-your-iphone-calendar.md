## Part 1: How to delete songs from your iPod touch directly

 If you get an iPod touch, then you are fortunate enough to delete songs from iPod touch directly. Apple offers users two ways to erase iPod music by itself.

### Method one: Delete songs off iPod touch selectively

 Open "Music" App – select "Songs" on the bottom – Check the songs that you want to erase – Slide to left and find the red "Detele" button – tap "Delete" to remove song from iPod one by one.

 In this way, you could erase iPod music without computer, but you have to delete the songs from iPod one by one.

### Method two: Erase all music from iPod quickly

 If you want to delete all songs from iPod touch, then you can try this way. Open "Settings" App on iPod, go to "General", find "Usage", select "Manage Storage", tap "Music". Tap "Edit" on the top right and choose "All Songs". Hit the red "-" icon to delete all the songs when the "Delete" button shows on the right.

 This way allows you to erase all iPod music quickly. But those deleted songs could be recovered with the help of some kind of recovery tools.

## Part 2: How to delete music from iPod with iTunes

### Method three: Remove iPod songs from iTunes

 For such classic iPod devices as iPod Nano, iPod Shuffle and iPod Classic, you have to erase them on your computer via iTunes. Steps are as following,

Step 1:

Connect iPod to computer with USB cable.

Step 2:

 Run iTunes on your PC and find your iPod (The iPod mark is below the menu bar, next to the apostrophe on the top left.) on iTunes.

Step 3:

Step 4:

 Click "Music" at "On My Device Column" and click the songs that you want to erase from your iPod on iTunes. Click "Delete" to erase music from your iPod Nano, iPod Shuffle and iPod Classic.

 This way works a little complicatedly, and you must perform it with caution. Besides, you could only remove songs from your iPod, but they still keep in your iTunes library and computer.

##  How to Check if You Have the Latest Version

 To see which version of iOS or iPadOS you have running on your iPhone or iPad, first open the Settings app. Tap the "General" category and tap "About" at the top of the screen.

 Look to the right of "iOS Version" or "iPadOS Version" to see the version number of the operating system on your iPhone or iPad. If it starts with "iOS 16", your device is running iOS 16.

##  How to Update to the Latest Version

 To [install the latest version of iOS](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-premium-webcam-guide-5-best-options-with-mic-integration/) or [update iPadOS](https://common-error.techidaily.com/wmi-optimization-tips-enhance-your-win11-efficiency/), head to Settings > General > Software Update on your phone or tablet. Your iPhone or iPad will check for newer versions of its operating system and offer any that are available here. If none are available for your device, it will let you know your device is up to date.

 This screen offers both major new versions---for example, if you're still running iOS 15, it will offer you iOS 16---as well as minor updates like iOS 16.1 and iOS 16.2, which fix bugs, patch security problems, and include other smaller changes.

 Your iPhone or iPad may occasionally show a notification telling you a new version of iOS or iPadOS is available, too.

 If no updates are available for your iPhone or iPad, you'll see an "iOS is up to date" or "iPadOS is up to date" message instead, along with the version of the OS your device is running

 You can also [use iTunes to update an iPhone or iPad](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-cutting-edge-techniques-for-incorporating-soundtracks-in-youtube-creations/).

##  Why Can't I Update to iOS 16?

 If your iPhone or iPad isn't running the iOS 16 or iPadOS 16 and it isn't offered to you via the Software Update screen, then [Apple is no longer supporting your device with software updates](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-pioneering-techniques-to-transform-your-obs-studio-projects/). While Apple tends to support its iPhone and iPads with the latest operating systems for longer than Android manufacturers support Android phones and tablets with [the latest version of Android](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-password-cracking-tools-for-motorola-razr-40-by-drfone-android/), the company doesn't support them forever.

 If you want the latest operating system, you'll have to [buy a new iPhone](https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-quick-vimeo-transformation-tips-easy-to-create-gifs/) or [modern iPad](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-capturing-screen-content-on-huawei-mate-10-20-and-p-series-phones-via-built-in-recorders/) that's still getting updates.

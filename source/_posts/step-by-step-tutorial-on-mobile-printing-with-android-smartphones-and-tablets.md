Step 3 After the system has been successfully restarted, connect your Kindle Fire device to your system.

Step 4 Go to your Windows Device Manager and look for "Android Composite ADB Interface" under "Kindle Fire". In case if it is not updated, you might see a yellow sign. It will simply ask you to update the interface which would take a few seconds.

Step 6 After successfully running the script, just unplug your Kindle device. To make sure that you have successfully rooted your Kindle Fire, install any File Explorer and go to "Tools" section. Your device will be tested as rooted.

## Root Kindle Fire with Kindle Fire Utility

 If you want to root Kindle Fire HD or a related device using Fire Utility, simply perform these easy steps.

Step 1 Make sure that you have installed the Kindle Fire drivers on your system. You can go to XDA developers and download the "Kindle Fire Utility" for Windows. Unzip the file and connect your Kindle device to your system.

Step 2 After connecting it, your system might ask you to install a few additional drivers. Click on the "install\_drivers.bat" file and it will commence the installation. Simply follow the on-screen instructions, as it might take a few minutes to install the needed drivers.

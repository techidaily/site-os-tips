## Revamped and Reimagined: A Comprehensive Review of the New Belkin Qi2 BoostCharge Pro Dual Wall & Car Mount, a Modern Take on an Iconic 3-in-1 iPhone Charger

### Key Takeaways

* The Belkin BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Stand offers Qi2 compatibility and adjustable tilt for iPhones.
* Priced at $149.99, this charger can power iPhones 12 and newer at 15W.
* Qi2 is similar to Apple's MagSafe, making the BoostCharge Pro compatible with various devices but still great for iPhone users.

 There are plenty of good 3-in-1 iPhone charging stands, but few are instantly recognizable as the [Belkin BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Stand](https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Wireless-Charging-Magnetic-Compatible/dp/B0CYDDTB8W?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002496&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbelkin-boostcharge-pro-qi2-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority). Instead of messing with the appearance, the company simply added Qi2 and a few tweaks to the new 2024 model.

##  How Does Qi2 Differ From MagSafe?

![Belkin BoostCharge Pro (Qi2) with an iPhone and Apple Watch charging](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/belkin-boostcharge-pro-qi2-with-an-iphone-and-apple-watch-charging.JPG)

 Qi2 is the second version of the Qi wireless charging standard. It bumps up the 7.5W speed to 15W and adds a magnetic ring for a centered charging alignment each time. If this sounds similar to Apple’s MagSafe technology, it’s because the Qi2 specs are borrowed or inspired by MagSafe—with Apple’s support.

 That means that any device adopting Qi2 certification should work with all compatible chargers, including this new BoostCharge Pro.

 To state the obvious, the BoostCharge Pro is still primarily geared toward iPhone owners, despite being more universally compatible. The main factor here is the Apple Watch charger. Apple’s watch only works with iPhones, so using an Android device here means that the spot is wasted.

 The ideal situation would be for owners of multiple phones, both Android and iPhone. The Qi standard is backward compatible, so you can take advantage of the new tilting charger to lay any wireless capable phone on the charger when an iPhone is not attached.

 Even though the bottom spot is advertised for charging AirPods, phones and other devices can still charge on the base as well. They’ll simply charge at a much slower pace.

##  An Ideal Nightstand iPhone and Apple Watch Charger

![Belkin BoostCharge Pro (Qi2) with an iPhone charging vertically](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/belkin-boostcharge-pro-qi2-with-an-iphone-charging-vertically.JPG) 

Tyler Hayes / How-To Geek

 Ever since the first BoostCharge Pro debuted, I’ve loved its bold, modern design. That design still shines, even several years on.

 Although it’s hard to tell at first glance, there are design tweaks that make it feel new and refreshed. The base is slightly smaller and more rounded on its sides. The Qi2 charger rotates, or tilts, up to 90 degrees. Instead of a permanently wired AC adapter on the end of the cable, there’s now a USB-C plug and a 36W power adapter in the box. It all adds up to a nicer experience, even if subtle.

 The tilting phone charger is the new star of the show. Yes, you can flip it up to lay a phone or it horizontally, but more importantly, its smooth rotation allows for small viewing angle tweaks. No matter what height your bed or nightstand is, you can adjust the stand to be at the right angle. When an iPhone 15 or 15 Pro is turned sideways and in StandBy mode, your clock can also be at the perfect angle.

 Although I never had much of a problem with the angle of the fixed-position charger, I loved being able to fully adjust my phone. Similarly, I never had much of an issue with the old base size, but the smaller one has definitely been a welcome change.

 If you’ve had your eye on the [Belkin BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Stand](https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Wireless-Charging-Magnetic-Compatible/dp/B0CYDDTB8W?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002496&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbelkin-boostcharge-pro-qi2-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) for some time, this is as good a time as any to take the plunge. The tweaks are minimal. So I wouldn’t recommend owners of the previous 3-in-1 version upgrade, but it's a great all-in-one option for first-time buyers. The biggest choice is deciding whether you need that third charging spot or if the [BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1 Stand](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-mastering-the-art-of-using-ez-grabber-with-this-tutorial-for-2024/) would suit your needs fine.

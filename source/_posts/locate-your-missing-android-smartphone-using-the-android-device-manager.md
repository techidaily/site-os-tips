 When your Android phone's batter is running out of power, you' ll get an "Low Power" or "Empty Battery" indicator on the screen when you attempt to turn it on. If the batter is dead completely, you have no chance to turn on the Android phone. To fix the issue, just plug your Android phone into a wall charger to charge it. You should not turn on your Android phone immediately when charge the device, getting it charged for a few minutes. Then come back and try to turn on your Android phone with pressing the Power button. If it doesn't work at all, try charging the Androidd phone with a different cable and charger.

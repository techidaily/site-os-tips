Then sign them both into the same Apple ID account.</li><li>Your iPhone should now appear as an option in the microphone dropdown menu for whatever app you’re using.</li><li>To set it as the default microphone for macOS, select it from System Settings &gt; Sound &gt; Output &amp; Input.</li></ul><p> Before you buy a USB microphone, try using your iPhone. The macOS Ventura update allowed you to use your iPhone as a wireless microphone for your Mac. It’s a quick and easy trick that can improve your mic quality in video meetings, though it’s also useful when recording voiceovers, podcasts, or music.</p><h2 id="System-Requirements-for-iPhone-Mic-Functionality"><a href="#System-Requirements-for-iPhone-Mic-Functionality" class="headerlink" title="System Requirements for iPhone Mic Functionality"></a>System Requirements for iPhone Mic Functionality</h2><p> The macOS Mojave update introduced <a class="link"   href="https://dvd-bd.techidaily.com/diy-tutorial-transform-your-mp4-videos-into-a-professional-costless-dvd-with-ease/" >Continuity Camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a feature that turns your iPhone into a webcam. This functionality was later updated in macOS Ventura, giving you the option to use Continuity Camera without a video feed. In other words, your iPhone can double as a wired or wireless microphone for your Mac.</p><p> You must meet the following requirements to use this feature:</p><ul><li>Ensure that your Mac and iPhone are registered under the same Apple ID.</li><li>Install macOS Ventura and iOS 16 (or later).</li><li>Enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on your Mac and iPhone.</li><li>Enable Continuity Camera in your iPhone’s settings (this is enabled by default).</li><li>Plug your iPhone into your Mac to register it as a trusted computer (you can unplug it afterward).</li></ul><p> You do not need a specific model of Mac or iPhone to use this feature. So long as your devices are running macOS Ventura and iOS 16 (or later releases), you’re good. An iPad running iPadOS 16 (or later) can also be used as a wired or wireless Mac microphone.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-the-iPhone-as-Your-System-Wide-Mic-on-macOS"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-iPhone-as-Your-System-Wide-Mic-on-macOS" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the iPhone as Your System-Wide Mic on macOS"></a>How to Use the iPhone as Your System-Wide Mic on macOS</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/21-3.png"                      alt="Selecting the iPhone as a microphone in macOS settings."                > </p><p> After meeting the requirements listed in the above section, your iPhone will appear as an audio input device on most websites and apps. But if you want apps and websites to automatically select your iPhone, you need to set it as your system-wide microphone. This is a quick and easy process, and while it isn’t necessary, it’s the best way to check that everything’s working. Also, some of your Mac’s default apps (including Voice Memo) are only allowed to use macOS’s system-wide microphone.</p><p> Open your Mac’s System Settings and click the “Sound” tab in the sidebar. Under the “Output &amp; Input” section, you’ll see two tabs—one for your audio output devices, and another for your audio input devices. Your iPhone should appear under the audio input tab. Select your iPhone, and it will become the system-wide audio input device. (If you complete this process while your iPhone is plugged into your Mac, it will operate as a wired mic with reduced latency.)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/20-3.png"                      alt="Notification that shows on-screen when using iPhone as Mac microphone."                > </p><p>Andrew Heinzman &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> When you use the iPhone as a wired or wireless mic, a dialog box with “Pause” and “Disconnect” controls will appear on its lock screen. Pressing the “Pause” button will mute the mic’s audio. The “Disconnect” button cuts the connection completely, as if you’ve unplugged the microphone.</p><p> Once your iPhone shows the dialog box with “Pause” and “Disconnect” buttons, look at the “Input Level” meter at the bottom of your Mac’s “Sound” settings page. Speak near the iPhone (or make other noises), and the meter should respond accordingly. If you want to test the iPhone’s microphone quality, open Voice Memos on your Mac and record yourself speaking. (By default, Voice Memos applies some compression to your recordings. You can select the <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/guide/voice-memos/change-voice-memos-settings-vm0ba246ff3e/" >lossless recording <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> setting to avoid compression, though the difference in quality is negligible on most speakers and headphones.)</p><h2 id="Select-Your-iPhone-as-a-Mic-on-Websites-Apps-and-Games"><a href="#Select-Your-iPhone-as-a-Mic-on-Websites-Apps-and-Games" class="headerlink" title="Select Your iPhone as a Mic on Websites, Apps, and Games"></a>Select Your iPhone as a Mic on Websites, Apps, and Games</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/8-1.png"                      alt="Selecting the iPhone as a microphone in Google Meet"                > </p><p> You don’t <em>need</em> to set your iPhone as your Mac’s system-wide microphone. And, for better or worse, some websites and apps won’t comply with your system-wide microphone setting. In any case, you can manually select your iPhone from the website or app’s audio input menu.</p><p> This is an extremely simple process, especially on video chat platforms like Zoom and Google Meet. However, audio input settings can be hard to find in video editors, DAWs, and other specialized applications.</p><p> If you’re using a browser-based video chat service, such as Google Meet (or Zoom if you’re directed by an invite link), your microphone settings will appear in the preview lobby before you join a meeting. Click the “Microphones” dropdown menu, select your iPhone, and you’re good to go. After doing this once, the video chat service may automatically select your iPhone-turned-microphone the next time you log in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/12-3.png"                      alt="Selecting a microphone in the Zoom desktop app."                > </p><p> Desktop video chat platforms, including the Zoom app, add a few steps to this process. Open Zoom or your video chat platform of choice and press the Command and comma (CMD+,) keys at the same time. This will open the app’s settings. Then, navigate to the “Audio” or “Sound” tab. Under the “Microphones” or “Audio Input Devices” dropdown, select your iPhone.</p><p> This process also applies to most video games. Open settings by pressing Command and comma, go to the audio tab, and select your iPhone as the microphone. Just know that every game is different. You may need to dig through a game’s settings or do a bit of Googling to get this set up.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Your-iPhone-as-a-Mic-in-a-DAW-or-Video-Editor"><a href="#How-to-Use-Your-iPhone-as-a-Mic-in-a-DAW-or-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Your iPhone as a Mic in a DAW or Video Editor"></a>How to Use Your iPhone as a Mic in a DAW or Video Editor</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/19-2.png"                      alt="Selecting the iPhone as an audio input device in Ableton Live."                > </p><p> Those who create videos, podcasts, or music may want to use their iPhone as a wireless mic in a video editor or DAW. But applications like Premiere Pro and Ableton Live don’t always comply with macOS’s system-wide audio settings (which makes sense in practice but can be a bit of an inconvenience). So, you have to adjust some settings by hand.</p><p> A wireless connection to your iPhone will suffer from latency. If you <em>need</em> real-time monitoring, plug your iPhone into your Mac and use it as a wired mic.</p><p> Open your video editor or DAW’s settings by pressing the Command and comma keys (CMD+,) simultaneously. Then, navigate to the “Audio” or “Devices” tab in the app’s settings. You should see a dropdown menu labeled “Audio Input Devices,” “Recording,” or “Microphone.” Select your iPhone from this dropdown menu.</p><p> These instructions should work in most creative software. That said, some apps are a little wonky—Final Cut Pro only allows you to select your audio input device after opening the “Record Voiceover” panel from the “Windows” tab in your menu bar. If you have trouble selecting an audio input device in your video editor or DAW, check its user manual.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

There may be a better way. Here are some tips for letting go of folders while still being able to find your apps efficiently.</p><h2 id="Launch-Apps-Quickly-with-Spotlight-or-Siri-Instead"><a href="#Launch-Apps-Quickly-with-Spotlight-or-Siri-Instead" class="headerlink" title="Launch Apps Quickly with Spotlight or Siri Instead"></a>Launch Apps Quickly with Spotlight or Siri Instead</h2><p> If your first instinct when launching an app is to unlock your iPhone, find a folder, tap it, then find the app you want to launch, you should know there’s a better way. Spotlight is your device’s built-in search feature and it works great for quickly launching applications.</p><p> Simply unlock your iPhone, swipe down on the home screen to reveal the search box, and start typing. The keyboard will automatically appear so you can quickly enter your query. As you type, different apps will appear. All you need to do is tap on the icon, and you’re done.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spotlight_search_iphone.jpg"                      alt="Use Spotlight to launch apps on iPhone"                > </p><p> You don’t even need to finish typing the app name before the icon will appear. The more you use the feature, the more relevant your searches will become. For example, if you have two apps that start with the same letters, the one you use more frequently will be suggested more often.</p><p> This works great for apps that aren’t important enough to find their way onto your first home screen but that you still use occasionally. You can search for other things, too, like Settings menus, contacts, Notes, and more—there are a lot of <a class="link"   href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-a-zte-nubia-z60-ultra-easily-by-drfone-android/" >great Spotlight search features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you may not be aware of!</p><p> Alternatively, if you prefer to bark orders at your phone, you can tell Siri to “Launch App Name” instead.</p><h2 id="Trust-Siri-to-Find-the-App-You-Want"><a href="#Trust-Siri-to-Find-the-App-You-Want" class="headerlink" title="Trust Siri to Find the App You Want"></a>Trust Siri to Find the App You Want</h2><p> In a similar vein to using Spotlight to search for apps you want to use, give Siri Suggestions a shot too. Siri learns from your habits and suggests apps based on criteria like time, date, and location. You just need to make sure the “Show Suggestions” is enabled underneath the “Before Searching” section in Settings &gt; Siri &amp; Search.</p><p> Now when you swipe down on your home screen, you’ll see a panel of apps at the top of the screen under the “Siri Suggestions” heading. Tap “Show More” to expand this to a selection of eight apps. These are apps that Siri thinks you might want to use, based on your habits.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/siri_suggestions_iphone.jpg"                      alt="Rely on Siri to surface apps with Siri Suggestions on iPhone"                > </p><p> You’ll also see some suggested activities, like playing a specific podcast or creating a route to an oft-traveled location. These aren’t always apps you use a lot, but rather apps that are relevant to what Siri thinks you’re up to right now.</p><h2 id="Carefully-Curate-Your-Main-Home-Screen"><a href="#Carefully-Curate-Your-Main-Home-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Carefully Curate Your Main Home Screen"></a>Carefully Curate Your Main Home Screen</h2><p> Folders are an inefficient way of finding apps you frequently use. If you’re constantly navigating to folders to access an app, it’s time to break it out of the folder and put it in a more convenient location. There is no more convenient location than your first or “main” Home screen.</p><p> Putting an app on your first Home screen means you can access it with a swipe and a tap. You should frequently evaluate what’s on your home screen, which apps you’re using, and which apps you aren’t.</p><p> Swap those that you don’t use (even those well-meaning mindfulness and meditation apps) out if they aren’t being used. Replace them with apps that require more swipes and taps instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ios_home_Screen.jpg"                      alt="Pick your iPhone Home screen apps carefully for maximum efficiency"                > </p><p> Your first home screen should be where you put the apps you use most frequently—apps you don’t want to search for or swipe to find. Important things like banking apps, your preferred Mail client, entertainment you turn to like podcasting or music apps, or news sources you read daily.</p><p> Don’t feel beholden to Apple and leave first-party apps on there because you feel like you should. If you don’t download a lot of apps, get rid of the App Store. You can access all of these features using Spotlight instead. You can even search the App Store right from Spotlight by entering your query and then using the “Search App Store” button at the bottom of the screen.</p><p> Having fewer Home screens is always better, especially if you use your device’s App Library.</p><h2 id="The-App-Library-Sorts-Apps-for-You-Anyway"><a href="#The-App-Library-Sorts-Apps-for-You-Anyway" class="headerlink" title="The App Library Sorts Apps for You Anyway"></a>The App Library Sorts Apps for You Anyway</h2><p> The App Library lives at the end of your list of home screens and automatically sorts and categorizes apps for you. It allows you to live a folder-free life, with apps organized based on the developer’s categorization. To find it, swipe left as many times as it takes you to get to a tiled list of app categories.</p><p> Your device will categorize apps into relatively broad but still helpful categories like “Information &amp; Reading” and “Travel” among others. The top three apps in each category (based on your usage will be shown. Tap on the fourth icon (which looks like a collection of smaller icons) to see the full list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/app_library_iphone.jpg"                      alt="Let your iPhone organize apps for you with the App Library"                > </p><p> Unlike folders which only show nine apps at a time, the App Library provides a scrolling list of apps. Apps don’t show up in multiple categories, and you can’t move an app from one category to another. You’ll also see a “Suggestions” section (which mirrors the aforementioned Siri Suggestions) and a “Recently Added” section which is handy for finding an app you just installed.</p><p> If you swipe up on this screen you will see an alphabetized list of apps that currently reside on your device. Use the letters to the right of the list to quickly jump around.</p><h2 id="Widgets-are-a-Better-Use-of-Your-Screen-Space"><a href="#Widgets-are-a-Better-Use-of-Your-Screen-Space" class="headerlink" title="Widgets are a Better Use of Your Screen Space"></a>Widgets are a Better Use of Your Screen Space</h2><p> Where available and depending on the app, widgets make a lot of sense. These commonly take up a 1x4, 2x2, or 2x4 space on your home screen and display useful information. Some are designed to simply brighten your day (like the Photos widgets), while others are practical and remove the need to open an app at all (like weather widgets).</p><p> Widgets are arguably a better use of precious Home screen space than folders. This is especially true of weather apps, <a class="link"   href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-music-from-samsung-galaxy-f14-5g-to-ipod-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/" >Shortcuts widgets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Calendar widgets, and even to-do list widgets. Apple has already <a class="link"   href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/assessing-data-protection-risks-in-using-chatgpt-technology/" >announced that widgets are getting smarter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS 17, allowing for more interaction on the Home screen (or Mac desktop) like ticking items off a list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/widgets_iphone_home.jpg"                      alt="iPhone widgets display information and act as app shortcuts"                > </p><p> Best of all, you can <a class="link"   href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/delete-gmail-account-withwithout-password-on-xiaomi-13t-by-drfone-android/" >put widgets on the Today screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, accessed by swiping right from your primary Home screen. Access your apps using widgets and you don’t need to dedicate a precious space to them on your Home screen. To edit your Home or Today screen, simply tap and hold an icon or existing widget and tap “Edit Home Screen” from the menu that appears.</p><h2 id="Delete-Apps-if-You-Have-to-Browse-Folders"><a href="#Delete-Apps-if-You-Have-to-Browse-Folders" class="headerlink" title="Delete Apps if You Have to Browse Folders"></a>Delete Apps if You Have to Browse Folders</h2><p> Many of us fall into the trap of holding on to too much stuff, whether it’s email, the contents of your Downloads folder (<a class="link"   href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-and-fixing-audio-glitches-in-youtube-videos-on-windows-11/" >shouldn’t you be emptying that? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>), and apps we never or rarely ever use. I’ve found old Apple Arcade games on my iPhone, despite not having an active subscription for over 18 months. Many of these apps get filed away neatly into folders and forgotten about.</p><p> There’s an argument to be made that folders make it easy to find apps you might have forgotten about. The counter-argument to this is that if you need to browse for apps you have forgotten about, perhaps you’re better off deleting the apps instead. This isn’t a hard and fast rule, but it’s something to think about if you have pages of folders clogging up your Home screen space.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/last_opened_app.jpg"                      alt="See when an app was last opened in your iPhone Settings"                > </p><p> Head to Settings &gt; General &gt; iPhone Storage and wait for the list to populate. Each app listed here will have a “Last Used” date, which can be a real eye-opener. You can swipe left on an app to “Offload” it (which retains user data) or “Delete” it (which gets rid of everything).</p><h2 id="iPhone-Folders-Kinda-Suck"><a href="#iPhone-Folders-Kinda-Suck" class="headerlink" title="iPhone Folders Kinda Suck"></a>iPhone Folders Kinda Suck</h2><p> iPhone folders are better than they were when they first arrived with the iOS 4 update, but they’re less necessary than they once were. The ability to remove app icons from your iPhone Home screen by tapping the “X” next to a wiggling icon and choosing “Remove from Home Screen” means that folders are no longer necessary to hide apps like Stocks or FaceTime.</p><p> On top of this, the App Library organizes everything for you. Spotlight was always useful, but your device’s ability to learn from your habits makes it even more effective. Folders still only display nine apps at a time on a 3x3 square, while taking up the whole screen. There’s a lot of scrolling involved in a folder that’s packed full of apps.</p><p> Making an iPhone folder by accident is way too easy, and deleting a folder is a pain since you need to remove all the apps inside it first.</p><p> Of course, folders still have a place in iOS (and iPadOS). There are arguments to be made for very niche interests or apps that require more granular categorization within genres of apps.</p><p> For example, if you’re into making music on your iPhone you might want separate folders for drum machines and synthesizers, while mobile game aficionados might want to keep things a little more organized or maintain a “Now Playing” folder for current apps of interest.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/iphone_folder.jpg"                      alt="Special interest iPhone folder"                > </p><p> We recommend treating folders more like an archive or collection than a practical way of accessing applications and using them sparingly. Get into the habit of <a class="link"   href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-a-zte-nubia-z60-ultra-easily-by-drfone-android/" >relying on Spotlight <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or Siri, and be disciplined with what you allow on your Home screen so that you spend less time looking for things and more time using your apps.</p><p> If you’re in a phone-organizing sort of mood now, be sure to check out some <a class="link"   href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-top-30-whatsapp-biographies-for-every-astrology-follower/" >more tips for organizing your iPhone apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

This is the concept that drives Contact Posters, one of the headlining features of iOS 17.

Get decent sound on the cheap by using your Apple Watch as a microphone and syncing the audio in your video editor instead.</p><h2 id="Why-Use-Your-Apple-Watch-as-a-Mic"><a href="#Why-Use-Your-Apple-Watch-as-a-Mic" class="headerlink" title="Why Use Your Apple Watch as a Mic?"></a>Why Use Your Apple Watch as a Mic?</h2><p> Using your Apple Watch as a microphone is a practical way to capture spoken word audio without having to buy a separate microphone. It’s convenient if you need to use your iPhone or another camera to capture video, but you’re stuck with underwhelming on-camera audio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/applewatch-9.png"                      alt="applewatch-9"                > </p><h5 id="Apple-Watch-Series-9"><a href="#Apple-Watch-Series-9" class="headerlink" title="Apple Watch Series 9"></a>Apple Watch Series 9</h5><p>$299 $399 Save $100 </p><p>The Apple Watch Series 9 provides an incremental upgrade over its predecessor, the Apple Watch Series 8. However, this doesn’t make it a subpar wearable device by any means. Rather, it means that an already impressive device has been improved slightly. The Series 9 features a superior chip, a brighter display, and some exciting new features on the horizon.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSTJ2Y5F?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004207&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/why-i-use-my-apple-watch-as-a-microphone-for-videos-and-how/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Buy on Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-watch-device-accessories/apple-watch-series-9/pcmcat1694543524033.c?id=pcmcat1694543524033" >See at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p> It’s especially good for piece-to-camera and one-on-one style interviews since you can carefully position the Apple Watch right in front of whoever is speaking while your camera is much further away. Just be sure not to obscure the Watch or touch it while recording to get the best possible audio quality.</p><p> Speaking of audio quality, the <a class="link"   href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-elite-hd-visual-snapshot-solutions-for-2024/" >Voice Memos app on your Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> records <em>passable</em> audio. It’s not going to replace a proper microphone, but it’s a lot better than relying on most on-camera audio especially when the camera is some distance away.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/voice_memos.jpg"                      alt="Voice Memos for Apple Watch."                > </p><p>Tim Brookes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Analysis of a 15-second voice recording taken on my Apple Watch revealed a mono M4A file with a tiny file size of 166kB, a variable bitrate of 65kbps, and a sample rate of 48kHz. It’s not going to knock your socks off, but for spoken word, it sounds pretty good.</p><p> Once you’ve finished recording, your audio will transfer automatically to your iPhone and sync via iCloud to your Mac if you have enabled the feature.</p><h2 id="Use-Voice-Memos-to-Record-Audio"><a href="#Use-Voice-Memos-to-Record-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Use Voice Memos to Record Audio"></a>Use Voice Memos to Record Audio</h2><p> This technique depends on using the Voice Memos app on your Apple Watch to record audio separately to your camera. You’ll then need to sync the audio to your video, something you can do manually or automatically (for free) depending on what you’re using to edit the video.</p><p> First, start recording video on your camera. Next, start recording audio on your Apple Watch using the Voice Memos app by tapping the big red record button. Now, position yourself in shot on the camera and clap clearly and loudly. This will help you (or your software) sync the clip later.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cinematic_mode_video-1.png"                      alt="Shallow depth of field in Cinematic mode on an iPhone camera."                > </p><p>Tim Brookes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> You can now conduct your interview or record your piece-to-camera. When you’re done, stop recording on both devices. If you mess up, it’s a good idea to either keep both devices rolling (and edit out the bad take) so that you don’t end up with too many separate files which can make things more complicated later.</p><p> Once you stop your audio recording, you’ll find the audio on your iPhone and possibly your Mac too.</p><h2 id="Sync-the-Audio-to-Your-Video"><a href="#Sync-the-Audio-to-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Sync the Audio to Your Video"></a>Sync the Audio to Your Video</h2><p> Use the “Share” feature in Voice Memos for iPhone to add the M4A file to your iCloud Drive, other cloud storage provider, email, or wherever you’re planning to edit. On a Mac, you can simply drag the recording to a folder of your choice.</p><p> The simplest way to sync your audio and video is to use <a class="link"   href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-complete-guide-to-tecno-pova-5-frp-bypass-everything-you-need-to-know-by-drfone-android/" >the best free video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve" >DaVinci Resolve <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s available for both Windows and Mac and is worth taking the time to learn considering how powerful it is. Open the app, create a new project with your files, and use the “Cut or “Edit” interface to place your video and audio file into the timeline.</p><p> Now, select both clips by Command- or Ctrl-clicking then click on Clip &gt; Auto Align Clips &gt; Based on Waveform. DaVinci Resolve will look at the audio and match your clips up. Next, mute or delete (right-click, “Unlink clips” and then select and delete) the in-camera audio track for best results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/screenshot-2024-07-17-at-13-52-00.png"                      alt="DaVinci Resolve Auto Align Clips tool in the Edit interface."                > </p><p> If you need to do this manually, use an editor that lets you see the waveform view and zoom in. You should see a big spike near the start of your audio where you clapped. Use this to help align your clips. Lots of video editors have auto-align tools built in, like <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GN6scDjgsc" >Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Have a look through the support documents to figure out how to the tools.</p><h2 id="Doing-Lots-of-Recording-Get-a-Real-Microphone"><a href="#Doing-Lots-of-Recording-Get-a-Real-Microphone" class="headerlink" title="Doing Lots of Recording? Get a Real Microphone"></a>Doing Lots of Recording? Get a Real Microphone</h2><p> I used this technique when helping my partner with a remote learning course, where simple video production was necessary for tutors to gauge progress. In-camera microphones on an iPhone and Sony mirrorless camera were a letdown. The Apple Watch provided far more usable results.</p><p> But this is by no means a substitute for a proper microphone. If you’re going to be doing a lot of recording, get a <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=shotgun+microphone&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004207&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/why-i-use-my-apple-watch-as-a-microphone-for-videos-and-how/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >shotgun microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or wireless <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=lavalier+microphone&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004207&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/why-i-use-my-apple-watch-as-a-microphone-for-videos-and-how/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >lavalier microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead.

For best results, shoot your photos in good light, using a tripod, and manually focusing where necessary.</p><p> Fixing blurry photos or low-resolution images isn’t the impossible task it used to be. Access to photo editors and tools that use artificial intelligence means your chances of success are better than they once were, and as the tech improves things are only going to get better.</p><h2 id="Use-Your-Photo-Editor’s-Sharpening-Tool"><a href="#Use-Your-Photo-Editor’s-Sharpening-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Use Your Photo Editor’s Sharpening Tool"></a>Use Your Photo Editor’s Sharpening Tool</h2><p> The most straightforward solution for a blurry photo is launching your favorite photo editor and using its sharpening tool. This fix can only go so far and works best for photos that lack a bit of definition rather than instances where autofocus has completely failed you. The effect will tighten up edges that are already there but won’t do a lot to fix motion blur or the softest areas of focus. In the case of motion blur, it can make the effect a little more pronounced by sharpening the trails caused by the slower shutter speed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sharpen_photos_mac-1.png"                      alt="Sharpen settings in Photos for Mac"                > </p><p> There’s no single tool you should use for this since most photo editors have a sharpening slider you can play around with. If you go too far with it things might start to look a bit too crispy, so make sure you stop before you reach that point. Some editors have other sliders you might want to use to increase definition such as “Clarity” in Adobe products and “Definition” in Apple’s editors.</p><p> If you’re shooting on your smartphone you can use this tip in your device’s editor as soon as you’ve shot the image.

Success here relies on AI being able to identify subjects within the photo to make enhancements, so results can be a bit all over the place. You might want to try a few different tools until you get the results you’re looking for.</p><p> It’s can be difficult for AI to understand which parts of the image you want intentionally blurred (like a background) and which parts should be sharpened. Results may be good in instances where your focus is a bit off against a relatively plain background, but you might have more trouble if your subject is out of focus and you’re going for a background with a soft depth-of-field effect too.</p><p> Unfortunately, these tools are rarely free. Most are either credit-based or use a subscription fee, except one prominent buy-it-outright tool. Here are the best options that we found.</p><h3 id="Fotor"><a href="#Fotor" class="headerlink" title="Fotor"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.fotor.com/" >Fotor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p> Fotor is a web-based photo editor with a free trial. The best thing about Fotor is that you can try it out before you buy to get a real preview of the sorts of results you can expect. Of the free web-based options on this list, Fotor did the best job. You can sign up for free and then upload a photo, then click on the “AI Enlarger” tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/fotor.png"                      alt="Fotor web app"                > </p><p> You can then move the vertical line in the middle of the screen to compare the original and the improved version. Fotor managed to pick out and enhance some of the fur in our blurry cat photo, but the motion blur in our moving train photo proved harder to fix.</p><p> Fotor aggressively pushes its Pro trial, which you have to sign up for to export anything. When your free trial expires your images will be watermarked. You can <a class="link"   href="https://www.fotor.com/pricing/" >sign up <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for $8.99&#x2F;month to get access to Fotor’s full feature set and lose the watermark.</p><h3 id="Topaz-Sharpen-AI"><a href="#Topaz-Sharpen-AI" class="headerlink" title="Topaz Sharpen AI"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.topazlabs.com/sharpen-ai" >Topaz Sharpen AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p> Topaz Sharpen AI is the most expensive tool on the list in that it’s a $79.99 outright purchase. That said, it’s the most impressive tool here and delivers the best results. The app runs natively on Windows and Mac computers, requiring over 2GB for the initial download and more than 500MB of model data to be downloaded on the first run.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/topaz_sharpen_ai.png"                      alt="Topaz Sharpen AI"                > </p><p> Sharpen AI will analyze your photo and select a profile that should work best to remove blur. You can also place your photo within a category that you think best defines it, then move the sliders to fine-tune the effect. The results are impressive. Though the effect was somewhat uneven, Sharpen AI was the only tool we tested that could meaningfully reduce the motion blur in our moving train photo.</p><p> The impressive results continued in our blurry cat photo, adding definition to the hair and removing some of the motion blur in other parts of the image. Best of all you can keep using Sharpen AI to enhance photos and even save photos with a watermark until you’re ready to buy. The app flew on our M1 Max MacBook Pro, but performance may vary depending on your computer.</p><h3 id="VanceAI"><a href="#VanceAI" class="headerlink" title="VanceAI"></a><a class="link"   href="https://vanceai.com/sharpen-ai/" >VanceAI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p> VanceAI is a lot like Fotor in that it’s a web-based solution. You can try it out without having to sign up or log in simply by uploading a photo and letting the tool go to work. The app allows you to specify the type of image you’re uploading, including blurry artwork or computer-generated imagery, text, low-resolution images from the web, and anime.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/vance_ai.png"                      alt="VanceAI web app"                > </p><p> You can also select a factor by which you want to upscale the image, and use sliders to change noise and blur suppression. In our tests VanceAI provided a much more subtle effect, picking out a few hairs on our blurry cat photo but doing little to resolve out-of-focus areas. The motion blur in our moving train picture remained almost identical.</p><p> VanceAI is probably better at improving heavily pixellated images and may work better on other types of images than those we were testing, so don’t write it off until you’ve given it a shot. You get a few free photos to begin with, after which you can sign up for <a class="link"   href="https://vanceai.com/pricing/?source=preview&medium=check_plans" >$4.95 to 100 credits <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h3 id="Adobe-Photoshop"><a href="#Adobe-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Adobe Photoshop"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" >Adobe Photoshop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p> The undisputed king of photo editing has a tool called Shake Reduction found under the Filter &gt; Sharpen menu. Unfortunately, Adobe removed this filter as of version 23.3.1 but if you pay for Photoshop you should be able to access the filter by installing the older 22.5.7 build (which you can do alongside the latest version).</p><p> Using this filter can help repair blur caused by camera shake. You can also <a class="link"   href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/fixing-low-speed-downloads-solutions-for-improving-your-utorrent-performance/" >use the Smart Sharpen tool to sharpen up an image <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that lacks definition.

Pick Another Frame"></a>Live Photo or Motion Photo?

To do this you will need to have shot the photo with this function turned on in the first place.</p><p> On an iPhone, open Photos and find the image in question. Now tap “Edit” in the top-right corner of the screen and then select the “Live Photo” button that appears at the bottom of the screen (it looks like three circles). You can now drag the viewfinder left and right to view all of the images captured as part of a Live Photo. Pick one that’s not blurry, then select “Make Key Photo” to select it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/make_key_photo.jpg"                      alt="&quot;Make Key Photo&quot; using Live Photo on iPhone"                > </p><p> Now when you export your photo (with or without Live Photos enabled), you will export whichever frame you chose, rather than the original blurry exposure.</p><p> On a Samsung device, the process is largely the same. While browsing a Motion Photo on your device, tap “View Motion Photo” at the bottom of the screen. Select a frame using the slider, then tap on the “Capture” button on the bottom-left corner of the screen to save the image as a new photo.</p><h2 id="Avoiding-Blurry-Photos-to-Begin-With"><a href="#Avoiding-Blurry-Photos-to-Begin-With" class="headerlink" title="Avoiding Blurry Photos to Begin With"></a>Avoiding Blurry Photos to Begin With</h2><p> The best way to fix a blurry photo is to avoid making the mistakes that cause them in the first place. This is easier said than done, especially since many of us now depend on smartphones to take pictures for us on full auto. These devices are prone to making their own decisions (and mistakes) about the best course of action at any given time.</p><p> Still, there are a few things you can do to help improve the outcome of any photos you may take.</p><h3 id="Fix-Your-Focus"><a href="#Fix-Your-Focus" class="headerlink" title="Fix Your Focus"></a>Fix Your Focus</h3><p> You can fix your focus by <a class="link"   href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/transform-meetings-with-easy-to-follow-zoom-sharing-tips-for-2024/" >manually focusing your smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or camera before you take a shot. This technique works best when your camera and subjects are stationary, and in circumstances when you don’t trust the camera to focus where you want it to.</p><p> On a smartphone, this is often done by tapping and holding your subject. Many cameras also have touchscreens that include touch-to-focus modes, and cameras that use interchangeable lenses (like <a class="link"   href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/latest-graphics-framework-refresh-enhanced-laptops-featuring-intel-core-ultra-and-amd-ryzen-series/" >mirrorless cameras <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-right-platform-for-content-creation-podcast-or-video/" >digital SLRs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) allow you to disable autofocus entirely and <a class="link"   href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/chatgpt-revolutionizes-creation-craft-your-own-custom-designed-gpt-models-like-never-before/" >focus using the lens barrel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/focus_lock_iphone.jpg"                      alt="Lock your focus in Camera for iPhone"                > </p><p> In very poor or challenging lighting conditions, manual focus can be a good option. For example, if you’re taking photos of a live music act with flashing lights, your subject might not be sufficiently illuminated when the camera takes its focus reading. The same is true when trying to capture something fleeting like a lightning storm.</p><h3 id="Night-Mode-and-Low-Light"><a href="#Night-Mode-and-Low-Light" class="headerlink" title="Night Mode and Low Light"></a>Night Mode and Low Light</h3><p> Many smartphones now come with a night shooting mode that <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-boost-popularity-quickly-top-30-hashtags-every-gamer-needs/" >uses multiple exposures and the wonders of AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to stitch together multiple exposures into a single image. These effects work great on still subjects like a night sky or quiet street, and not so well against moving objects like animals or human beings.</p><p> You can often switch off night mode simply by tapping a button on your smartphone’s camera interface. Apple has <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/amplify-your-storytelling-music-for-instagram-stories-and-videos/" >a dedicated button for this on the iPhone camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and most major Android smartphone manufacturers also have the feature now.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/night_mode_iphone.jpg"                      alt="Night mode toggle on iPhone"                > </p><p> When you switch off night mode, your camera will attempt to compensate by increasing the <a class="link"   href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-guide-samsung-galaxy-f54-5g-wireless-and-wired-screen-mirroring-drfone-by-drfone-android/" >shutter speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The longer the shutter speed, the more light makes it into the shot. Unfortunately, longer shutter speeds also mean blurrier photos in the case of movement.</p><p> You can try repositioning your subject to make use of better light or ask everyone to stand still. If you’re trying to capture a moving subject (like a car or someone running), try panning with them to capture an exaggerated shot with plenty of motion blur around the edges of the frame.</p><p> If all else fails, there’s always your smartphone’s flash but just remember that harsh front-facing illumination is often far from flattering.</p><h3 id="Use-a-Tripod-Monopod-or-Image-Stabilization"><a href="#Use-a-Tripod-Monopod-or-Image-Stabilization" class="headerlink" title="Use a Tripod, Monopod, or Image Stabilization"></a>Use a Tripod, Monopod, or Image Stabilization</h3><p> Put your smartphone or camera on a tripod (like one of our <a class="link"   href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/updated-noctua-nh-d15-g2-features-enhanced-silence-with-increased-heatpipes-and-modernized-offset-framework/" >top recommended iPhone tripods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) to keep the shot nice and still. This allows you to drop your shutter speed right down to capture lots of light without worrying about moving the camera. Use your camera or smartphone’s timer function so that pressing the shutter doesn’t cause any movement.</p><p> Many cameras now also include <a class="link"   href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-find-ispoofer-pro-activation-key-on-lava-blaze-curve-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >image stabilization features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> within the camera or lens. These features are limited to modern mirrorless or digital SLR models, with names like “Optical Steady Shot” (Sony).

Luckily, backing up to <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-breaking-barriers-worlds-best-and-largest-shorts-downloaders/" >iCloud <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is easy.</p><h2 id="Why-Backup-to-iCloud"><a href="#Why-Backup-to-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Why Backup to iCloud?"></a>Why Backup to iCloud?</h2><p> Having backups of your data is a good idea no matter where you store it. In fact, we recommend keeping <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-earnings-analysis-youtube-views-vs-financial-gain/" >multiple copies of anything you backup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> so that if one method fails for some reason you still have another.

The same applies for <a class="link"   href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-premium-webcam-guide-5-best-options-with-mic-integration/" >upgrading to a new version of iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, just in case something goes wrong.</p><p> Of course, you will have to make sure you have enough storage in your iCloud account. How much you need will depend on how much data you have stored on your iPhone, but you’ll get a notification if your storage isn’t big enough when you initiate the back up. There are a few things you can do to <a class="link"   href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-optimized-zoom-audio-settings-for-exceptional-listening/" >free up space <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and if you can’t make room you do have a few options for <a class="link"   href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/5-best-photo-editor-for-android-phone/" >saving money on an iCloud storage upgrade <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

So, is Apple’s high-end smartphone a smart buy for gaming?</p><h2 id="Why-the-iPhone-15-Pro-is-a-Big-Deal-for-Gamers"><a href="#Why-the-iPhone-15-Pro-is-a-Big-Deal-for-Gamers" class="headerlink" title="Why the iPhone 15 Pro is a Big Deal for Gamers"></a>Why the iPhone 15 Pro is a Big Deal for Gamers</h2><p> At its September 12 iPhone event, Apple announced two new iPhone models for 2023: the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 Pro, each with larger Plus and Max models for those who crave larger displays. Of particular note to gamers was the iPhone 15 Pro, with its new A17 Pro system-on-chip (SoC).</p><p> The revision introduced a GPU redesign, the part of the chip that’s responsible for graphics and 3D performance. Apple increased the core count to six from the five seen in last year’s A16 Bionic (now used in the base-level iPhone 15). Apple’s presentation mooted a 20% bump in performance, figures that benchmarks (like <a class="link"   href="https://browser.geekbench.com/ios%5Fdevices/iphone-15-pro" >Geekbench Metal <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) seem to corroborate.</p><p> In addition to an extra GPU core, Apple introduced some new features to bring gaming more in line with modern console experiences. The first is hardware-accelerated ray tracing, a term that’s becoming more common as hardware and software improve year-on-year.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/a17_ray_tracing-1.png"                      alt="Ray tracing comparison in the Apple A17 Pro presentation"                > </p><p> Ray tracing can be used to <a class="link"   href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/9-best-free-android-monitoring-apps-to-monitor-phone-remotely-for-your-honor-90-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/" >create more natural lighting effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with applications in shadows, reflections, and global illumination. Simulating light rays in a scene results in more realistic graphics. It also has benefits for developers who often need to spend time “faking” natural lighting effects.</p><p> On top of this, the new A17 Pro can take advantage of <a class="link"   href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-6-ways-to-change-spotify-location-on-your-itel-s23plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >MetalFX upscaling <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> much like modern Apple Silicon-powered Macs can. Upscaling is a method of image reconstruction that renders a lower-resolution image for better performance and then upscales that image to a higher resolution for a better overall image. It’s just like <a class="link"   href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/add-music-in-premiere-pro-for-2024/" >NVIDIA’s DLSS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-update-iphone-xs-max-to-the-latest-iosipados-version-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/" >AMD’s FSR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but Apple-flavored.</p><p> Improvements have been made to the A17 Pro to allow developers to take advantage of mesh shading. In essence, this makes for a more efficient geometry pipeline, which leads to better overall performance. It should mean smoother gameplay going forward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/a17_gpu_detail.png"                      alt="Apple A17 Pro GPU details"                > </p><p>Apple</p><p> Apple also made claims of a more efficient chip, which should have knock-on effects for battery life in 3D applications. And of course, the iPhone 15 Pro enjoys the same features that have been present for a while, including a bright and beautiful OLED screen, variable refresh rate support, a compact form factor, and compatibility with a huge number of game controllers.</p><h2 id="Some-Games-Will-Require-an-iPhone-15-Pro-or-M1-iPad"><a href="#Some-Games-Will-Require-an-iPhone-15-Pro-or-M1-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Some Games Will Require an iPhone 15 Pro (or M1 iPad)"></a>Some Games Will Require an iPhone 15 Pro (or M1 iPad)</h2><p> Perhaps the most surprising development in the iPhone gaming space is the announcement of games that will require an A17 Pro processor or better. That means only iPhone 15 Pro and iPad owners with an M1 chip will be able to play these releases when they arrive.</p><p> Of note are four titles: <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, <em>Resident Evil 4 (Remake)</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage,</em> and <em>Death Stranding</em>. The first release will be <em>Resident Evil Village</em> along with the <em>Winter’s Expansion</em> DLC, arriving on October 30, 2023.</p><p> This is a departure from Apple’s mobile gaming strategy thus far, but it’s part of a greater push for gaming within its ecosystem, as reflected by the arrival of <a class="link"   href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-erasing-your-conversations-with-chatgpt/" >macOS Game Mode in macOS Sonoma <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Though only four titles have been announced with A17 Pro exclusivity so far, more will surely follow.</p><p> This sees Apple effectively laying the groundwork for a gaming future on its mobile platforms that more closely mirrors that of consoles with big-name “AAA” releases more commonly associated with the PC and dedicated consoles. It’s an example of how far the silicon in our pockets has come. In a few years, when these chips (and their successors) trickle down to a greater range of devices, this higher tier of game releases will have a broader appeal on mobile.</p><h2 id="The-Downsides-of-Gaming-on-an-iPhone"><a href="#The-Downsides-of-Gaming-on-an-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="The Downsides of Gaming on an iPhone"></a>The Downsides of Gaming on an iPhone</h2><p> Whether you’re playing games or taking calls, an iPhone is an iPhone. Its primary purpose isn’t gaming, which means the experience has some drawbacks. First and foremost, you’re paying for a device that does a lot outside of playing games.</p><p> Gaming on a mobile device can be a disjointed experience. Though you can <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-designing-distinctive-denouements/" >set Focus modes to limit distractions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, by default, you will be interrupted by calls and notifications. This is why so many mobile games are built around the concept of short, sharp play sessions when you have a few minutes spare.</p><p> Take a <em>Resident Evil</em> title, for example. The idea of playing a <a class="link"   href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/80038" >12 hour <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>-long first-person experience with touch controls doesn’t sound particularly appealing given the experience you could be having on a PC or console. Of course, you <em>can</em> pair controllers with an iPhone, but <a class="link"   href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-masterful-viewing-for-artists-best-monitor-guide/" >you’ll need to buy controller clips <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (and a controller) or invest in something like the GameSir X2 to turn your iPhone into something that resembles the Nintendo Switch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/53213586619_ce8a78806c_o.jpg"                      alt="Rear of the Apple iPhone 15"                > </p><p>Corbin Davenport &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Then, there’s the overall form factor. Despite being blessed with a beautiful display, iPhone Pro models are still only 6.1 and 6.7-inch devices. Handheld gaming is great, both the Switch and Valve’s Steam Deck are proof of that, but the form factor is arguably better suited to certain types of experiences. You could be a lot more comfortable sitting a few feet away from your TV with a controller in your hand. The Switch can be docked with a TV for at-home play, while the Deck syncs with Steam so you can load your saves on a PC.</p><p> iPhone has power and heat concerns to contend with too. Battery life is always a concern when gaming on a portable system, let alone one that’s handling the rest of your digital life at the same time. The iPhone is also an entirely passively cooled device, which means that heat build-up could lead to a particularly sweaty-palmed experience.</p><p> This is especially true if you charge and play at the same time. While it’s unlikely to kill your iPhone, heat is the enemy of batteries and many other components. Many gamers have done it, but we probably shouldn’t all be doing it daily.</p><h2 id="Your-Money-May-Be-Better-Spent-Elsewhere"><a href="#Your-Money-May-Be-Better-Spent-Elsewhere" class="headerlink" title="Your Money May Be Better Spent Elsewhere"></a>Your Money May Be Better Spent Elsewhere</h2><p> The iPhone 15 Pro starts at $999, with the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Pro Max starting at $1199. For that money, you could buy an Xbox Series X <em>and</em> a PlayStation 5 to play on your TV at home, which you probably already have. Alternatively, you could save $500 and just buy one console, and use the change to invest in some games, a <a class="link"   href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-4-solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro/" >Game Pass subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or a <a class="link"   href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-top-strategies-for-capturing-lol-matches/" >PlayStation Plus subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/52625042776_21eb3e65d5_o.jpg"                      alt="Camouflage Skin on the PlayStation 5 with matching controller and headset."                > </p><p>Hannah Stryker &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> The performance will be better, the experience will arguably be more immersive, and you won’t be interrupted by spam callers and <a class="link"   href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-vimeo-create-how-to-edit-videos-on-vimeo-for-free/" >SMS scammers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. There’s also the small issue of how much Capcom is preparing to charge for <em>Resident Evil 4 (Remake)</em> on your iPhone, with the <a class="link"   href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/resident-evil-4-iphone-price/" >App Store listing a $59.99 unlock fee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> For even the most ardent mobile gamer that’s a tough sell. Even for those who <em>already own</em> the iPhone 15 Pro, how much is a pocketable <em>Resi</em> title worth? It feels like a compromised experience at a premium price point. Even a comparably-priced <a class="link"   href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamline-and-shine-the-top-5-video-quality-tools/" >small-format gaming PC like the ROG Ally <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has a choice of storefronts so that you can shop around.</p><h2 id="A-Promising-Future-for-iPhone-Games"><a href="#A-Promising-Future-for-iPhone-Games" class="headerlink" title="A Promising Future for iPhone Games"></a>A Promising Future for iPhone Games</h2><p> Despite the drawbacks of gaming on your iPhone, the direction Apple is taking with its chips is a promising one. If you buy an iPhone in the next few years, it’s probably going to have a significantly better GPU than you’re used to, with support for features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing and enough power to run high-end games.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/a17_pro_iphone.png"                      alt="Apple A17 Pro SoC found in the iPhone 15 Pro"                > </p><p>Apple</p><p> Apple took the iPhone 14 Pro’s A16 Bionic chip and slapped it in 2023’s iPhone 15. If the same happens next year, both Apple’s flagship iPhone and the one it expects most people to buy will be _Assassin’s Creed_-ready. That’s a big deal, even if you have no interest in creeping around ninth-century Baghdad for 100 hours.</p><p> It means that more casual mobile gaming experiences will be able to take advantage of better hardware, and that’s exciting.</p><h2 id="Step-Up-Your-iPhone-Gaming-with-Apple-Arcade"><a href="#Step-Up-Your-iPhone-Gaming-with-Apple-Arcade" class="headerlink" title="Step Up Your iPhone Gaming with Apple Arcade"></a>Step Up Your iPhone Gaming with Apple Arcade</h2><p> While $60 for a phone game might sound like a tall order, gaming on an iPhone doesn’t have to break the bank. If you haven’t <a class="link"   href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-create-snapchat-lenses-easily-2-methods/" >tried Apple Arcade recently <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you’ll be amazed at how much you get for $4.99 per month.</p><p> There’s a healthy mix of genres, enhanced versions of App Store classics, remasters and remakes, and not a single micro-transaction or advert to be found. You can even play with a controller, on a Mac, or with your Apple TV if you want.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

There was a lot of discussion about what to expect before launch, but a few surprises have caught reviewers off guard.</p><h2 id="The-Batteries-Are-Hefty-and-Can’t-Be-Hot-Swapped"><a href="#The-Batteries-Are-Hefty-and-Can’t-Be-Hot-Swapped" class="headerlink" title="The Batteries Are Hefty and Can’t Be Hot-Swapped"></a>The Batteries Are Hefty and Can’t Be Hot-Swapped</h2><p> The Vision Pro uses a removable battery that weighs 12.45oz (353g), a decision that moves the weight from your head to your pocket or waistband. The battery has a capacity of 3166mAh, which Apple says is good enough for around two hours of general use (or two-and-a-half hours of movie watching). Some reviewers, like <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkPw6ScHyb4&t=2620s" >Brian Tong <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, managed to get an extra 30 minutes out of their units.</p><p> Perhaps the biggest surprise here is that the battery is so heavy and large compared to its overall capacity. The iPhone 15 has a 3349mAh battery and the entire device weighs just 6.03oz (171g). <a class="link"   href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price" >Nilay Patel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of The Verge noted that the battery is “barely worth talking about” but that the battery itself is “very Apple” in terms of its limited capacity.</p><p> If you do spring for a $199 spare battery, be aware that you can’t hot-swap cells. That means when you disconnect one battery, the Vision Pro will shut down. It takes around 45 seconds for the unit to be usable again from a dead stop. You can charge the battery with the included 30w charger while you use the headset, though, effectively shackling yourself to a power outlet.</p><p> Interestingly, the Vision Pro battery pack appears to <a class="link"   href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24057392/apple-vision-pro-battery-lightning-cable" >hide a jumbo-sized Lightning cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which can be removed using an iPhone SIM removal tool.</p><h2 id="Personas-Are-Technically-Impressive-but-Strange-to-Look-At"><a href="#Personas-Are-Technically-Impressive-but-Strange-to-Look-At" class="headerlink" title="Personas Are Technically Impressive but Strange to Look At"></a>Personas Are Technically Impressive but Strange to Look At</h2><p> Personas are 3D representations of Vision Pro users, for use in FaceTime conversations. You can make a persona by scanning your face using the sensors on the front of the headset. From here, your persona is used when you’re on a FaceTime call, mimicking your expressions, movements, and even hand placement.</p><p> The feature has been launched in beta as it’s still not quite finished. One of the more impressive aspects of these personas is the way that the Vision Pro can pick up on micro-expressions, mouth movements, and other parts of your face that seemingly wouldn’t be well covered by the sensors.</p><p> There’s a fair amount of uncanny valley going on here, though. Personas resemble the wearer, but they don’t look exactly human. Hair doesn’t move and in some cases looks more like a hat. The same is true of any jewelry or clothing you were wearing when you did the scan. The feature is both technically impressive and slightly unsettling.</p><h2 id="Your-Eyes-Aren’t-Very-Visible-on-the-Front-Display"><a href="#Your-Eyes-Aren’t-Very-Visible-on-the-Front-Display" class="headerlink" title="Your Eyes Aren’t Very Visible on the Front Display"></a>Your Eyes Aren’t Very Visible on the Front Display</h2><p> Something that’s appeared heavily in pre-release materials is the fact that the Vision Pro has a screen on the front of the unit. Known as EyeSight, this is meant to give other people the impression that they can see your eyes. Cameras inside the unit watch your eyes and expressions and relay this to a display on the front that appears beneath a lenticular film, designed to give the illusion of depth.</p><p> Reviewers like <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&t=301s" >Marques Brownlee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> noted that your eyes aren’t that visible, though, and the feature can lead to some strange problems like your eyes appearing too far apart or in the wrong position. Other commentators have speculated that this is a first-generation feature and that it might be dropped in subsequent revisions.</p><h2 id="Some-Big-Apps-Are-Missing"><a href="#Some-Big-Apps-Are-Missing" class="headerlink" title="Some Big Apps Are Missing"></a>Some Big Apps Are Missing</h2><p> Likely a blip on the radar in the long term, anyone hoping to get immersed in YouTube or Netflix streams might be disappointed in their Vision Pro at launch. These are by far the two most prominent apps that have yet to materialize, which seems odd on a device that heavily emphasizes its video capabilities.</p><p> The best and biggest TV you own is strapped to your face, but you’ll have to use a Safari window to access two of the most prominent streaming services on the web. You can’t <a class="link"   href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/unova-stone-pokemon-go-evolution-list-and-how-catch-them-for-nokia-c12-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >add these to your home screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as web apps either (like you can on iPhone or iPad).</p><p> Interestingly, much like iOS and iPadOS apps on the Mac, developers have to opt out of having their <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-the-ultimate-expedition-manual-launching-a-career-in-travel-blogging/" >iPhone and iPad apps appear on the Vision Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This means that the decision to withhold these apps was a very deliberate one by the developers. This limits your offline viewing capabilities and forces you to interact with the website instead.</p><h2 id="It-May-Take-a-While-to-Find-That-“Killer”-App"><a href="#It-May-Take-a-While-to-Find-That-“Killer”-App" class="headerlink" title="It May Take a While to Find That “Killer” App"></a>It May Take a While to Find That “Killer” App</h2><p> There are purpose-built Vision Pro apps available right now, including 3D experiences from Disney, immersive star maps, and virtual DJ booths. Apple has adapted a great deal of its own software to work on the Vision Pro, and there are millions of iPhone and iPad apps that work out of the box. But there’s no single app right now that reviewers are pointing to as the reason to use a Vision Pro.</p><p> Marques Brownlee put forward the argument that Apple’s ecosystem might be the most compelling thing right now. Your photos, your notes, even your browsing sessions all come across when you set up your Vision Pro. It’s all there, waiting for you.</p><p> YouTube reviewer Brian Tong showed off the NBA app, which seems to be the killer app for basketball fans. The app shows live and archived streams, match and player statistics, and a multi-view feature that lets you watch more than one game at once and switch out what you see on the big screen. The logical conclusion to this is arguably a virtual court-side immersive view that works as a Vision Pro environment.</p><p> But this depends on what you’re into, what you’re hoping to use the Vision Pro for, and where the value proposition is for you.</p><h2 id="You-Only-Get-One-Virtual-Mac-Screen"><a href="#You-Only-Get-One-Virtual-Mac-Screen" class="headerlink" title="You Only Get One Virtual Mac Screen"></a>You Only Get One Virtual Mac Screen</h2><p> For some, the promise of using the Vision Pro as a Mac display is huge. This works, and it works well on a giant crisp 4K display that you can scale and reposition wherever you want. Unfortunately, you can only use a single display in this iteration, which dashes any hopes you may have of a virtual multi-monitor setup.</p><p> You can still open other windows in visionOS alongside your virtual Mac display. And you can smoothly move your cursor between them and the Mac screen, but everything they’ll be limited to visionOS apps, like Safari windows and the Notes app.</p><h2 id="Arranging-Windows-in-Space-Rules"><a href="#Arranging-Windows-in-Space-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Arranging Windows in Space Rules"></a>Arranging Windows in Space Rules</h2><p> One big takeaway from Marques Brownlee’s review was that the spatial aspect of the Vision Pro works very well. If you’ve tried augmented reality on an iPhone you’re probably used to objects feeling “floaty,” not quite sitting still on the surface they appear on, or glitching out.</p><p> The Vision Pro seems to have enough sensors and cameras pointing in every direction that this is no longer a problem. Windows genuinely seem to “lock” in place, and this is visible from much of the review footage we’ve seen. Multiple reviewers noted that this is the best video passthrough and most convincing mixed reality implementation they’ve ever seen and, considering the price, that’s a relief.</p><h2 id="Spatial-Audio-Is-Convincing-But-Not-Private"><a href="#Spatial-Audio-Is-Convincing-But-Not-Private" class="headerlink" title="Spatial Audio Is Convincing (But Not Private)"></a>Spatial Audio Is Convincing (But Not Private)</h2><p> There are two downward-firing speakers on the edge of the Vision Pro, and these deliver a spatial audio experience that has been heavily praised. It works well, but it’s possible for others in the room to hear what you’re doing.</p><p> This means that if you want to watch a movie on a flight and not draw attention to yourself, or you want to avoid distracting team members while you work listening to music, you’re going to need to put in some headphones. Fortunately, you can use any Bluetooth headphones with the Vision Pro, as long as you can get them to comfortably fit.</p><h2 id="Siri-Is-a-Big-Part-of-the-Experience"><a href="#Siri-Is-a-Big-Part-of-the-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Siri Is a Big Part of the Experience"></a>Siri Is a Big Part of the Experience</h2><p> The Vision Pro is an Apple product, so of course Siri was going to make an appearance. Perhaps what’s most surprising is how much you’ll end up leaning on Siri, as Brian Tong noted in his review. You can access the majority of functions using Siri, including launching and closing apps, switching to different immersive environments, and dictating text.</p><p> Text input is an interesting one. There are several ways to input text using the Vision Pro, and Siri is perhaps the easiest of the bunch. The built-in on-screen keyboard has been criticized for its poor typing speed and like any non-tactile typing surface the experience is far from satisfying.</p><p> You <em>can</em> use a real keyboard with the Vision Pro, just as you can use Apple’s trackpad, but you’re not always going to have these to hand. Ergo, you’re going to be dictating messages, launching software, and even dictating web searches and URLs out loud while you use the device for best results.</p><h2 id="You-Can’t-Rearrange-Your-Home-Screen-Yet"><a href="#You-Can’t-Rearrange-Your-Home-Screen-Yet" class="headerlink" title="You Can’t Rearrange Your Home Screen (Yet)"></a>You Can’t Rearrange Your Home Screen (Yet)</h2><p> visionOS is based on iPadOS, which gave Apple a big head start in terms of ecosystem and basic functionality. But customization isn’t quite there yet, and nowhere is this more evident than on the Home screen. Reorganizing your apps is currently not supported, which means you can’t put things into folders either.</p><p> Instead, you’ll get a screen of Apple apps with a folder for “Compatible Apps” designed for iPhone and iPad. After this, you’ll see a long list of third-party apps arranged in alphabetical order. This probably wasn’t a high priority for Apple, or maybe Apple’s just not sure how to implement this feature just yet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/visionos_apps.jpg"                      alt="Apple Vision Pro home screen in a visionOS Envrionment."                > </p><p>Apple</p><p> For now, you’ll have to stick with Siri if you want to get things done quickly, or simply pinch and drag to get where you want.</p><h2 id="You-Might-Prefer-To-Do-Things-Without-the-Vision-Pro"><a href="#You-Might-Prefer-To-Do-Things-Without-the-Vision-Pro" class="headerlink" title="You Might Prefer To Do Things Without the Vision Pro"></a>You Might Prefer To Do Things Without the Vision Pro</h2><p> The Vision Pro is a VR headset, even though Apple doesn’t use those terms. Reviewers noted that even though you see the world around you while you’re wearing the Vision Pro, this is relayed through cameras. This is the best Apple (or any company) can do right now with the current technology, and there are some downsides to contend with.</p><p> Weight and comfort are big deciders, and your personal tolerance will dictate how you feel about that.</p><p> Brian Tong noted that he only really wants to use the headset for an hour before taking a break. Nilay Patel pondered whether you’re happy to wear a headset that messes up your hair every time you take it on or off. Marques Brownlee noted that the Dual Loop Band (which comes in the box) provides a more comfortable experience, but it arguably looks worse and interferes with the top of your head.</p><p> And then there’s the slightly more existential stuff. In particular, Nilay Patel’s wrap-up talked a lot about being “out there” (in the “real” world) and “in here” (wearing the Vision Pro) and emphasized that the experience can be lonely and isolating. The EyeSight feature performs poorly and there’s a real disconnect between you and those around you while wearing the headset.</p><p> Despite the best-in-class passthrough and Apple’s attempts to bridge the gap between the wearer and everyone else, you might prefer to do many tasks outside of visionOS.

You can create alphabetical as well as similar-functions app folders for easy access to your apps. Both iPhone and Android allow you to make application folders.</p><p> Do you have so many apps installed on your phone it’s a struggle to find the one you really need when you need it? Here are a few things you can do to make finding and launching apps a faster and more efficient process.</p><h2 id="Use-Your-App-Search"><a href="#Use-Your-App-Search" class="headerlink" title="Use Your App Search"></a>Use Your App Search</h2><p> Probably the simplest solution to finding an app is to simply search for it. iPhone has <a class="link"   href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-advanced-techniques-for-quieter-video-calls-on-skype/" >Spotlight Search <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and on Android typing the name of an app into <a class="link"   href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/solved-move-from-honor-magic-5-lite-to-ios-not-working-problems-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/" >the Google widget <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can quickly bring it up too. You will have to always remember the name of the app you want, though, and typing on a keyboard can be a challenge if you’re using your phone one-handed.</p><h2 id="Group-Apps-to-Make-Them-Easier-to-Find"><a href="#Group-Apps-to-Make-Them-Easier-to-Find" class="headerlink" title="Group Apps to Make Them Easier to Find"></a>Group Apps to Make Them Easier to Find</h2><p> If you don’t want to have to type anything into a search bar, or if you prefer to search visually, you can speed up finding apps on your home screen by <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/how-to-create-video-ads-for-free-in-youtube-video-builder/" >grouping apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The iPhone and nearly all Android phones let you place two or more apps in a single container (called an app folder) taking up the space of one icon on your home screen. When you need an app, you tap the folder and all the apps inside it appear. You then launch your apps the same way you would do from your app drawer or home screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1-app-groups-android.png"                      alt="Grouped apps on an Android phone."                > </p><p> Not only do folders make finding apps easier, but they also declutter your home screen. With all of those apps neatly organized and put away you get a more stress-free, minimalist feel—or room for more <a class="link"   href="https://solve-info.techidaily.com/cookiebot-enabled-customized-user-experience-boosts-engagement-and-sales/" >widgets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-top-30-whatsapp-biographies-for-every-astrology-follower/" >6 Tips for Organizing Your iPhone Apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p> On an iPhone, make an app folder by first tapping and holding on a home screen until all the apps start jiggling and then dragging an app onto another app. On most Android phones, including Samsung’s Galaxy phones, you can create app folders by dragging one app and dropping it onto another app.</p><p> If you aren’t sure what kind of groups to make, one idea is to group your apps in alphabetic order. Doing so ensures you can find an app when you really need it without any struggle, so long as you remember the name. As an example, you can put the Uber app in a folder called “U Apps” or “U-Z”. This way, you know exactly where that app is when you’re out and about and want to get a taxi ride.</p><p> Another option is grouping apps by function. For example, you can place all <a class="link"   href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-navigating-the-art-of-online-photo-trimming/" >your instant messaging apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in a single folder, making it super easy to find the app you need when you want to chat or talk to someone. Similarly, you can group <a class="link"   href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-samsung-galaxy-m14-5g-android-system-webview-crash-2024-issue-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/" >all your streaming apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> into a single folder. This helps you save time and eliminates the hassle to go through multiple home screens to find the app you want.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elite-budget-free-fb-imagemotion-engineer/" >Why Are iPhones Still Limited to 9 Apps Per Folder Page? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Place-Apps-and-Folders-Strategically-on-the-Home-Screen"><a href="#Place-Apps-and-Folders-Strategically-on-the-Home-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Place Apps and Folders Strategically on the Home Screen"></a>Place Apps and Folders Strategically on the Home Screen</h2><p> Another way to simplify finding apps is to place your most frequently used apps within easy reach of your fingers. Google’s Pixel phones by default place your recently used apps at the bottom of the phone screen, but you might have some you don’t want ever out of reach.</p><p> A good idea if you’re right-handed, for example, is placing your favorite apps in the bottom-right corner of the home screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2-easy-reach-app-android.png"                      alt="An app in the bottom-right corner of an Android phone."                > </p><p> If you’re left-handed, use the bottom-left corner. That way, even when you need to <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/24-unveiling-the-most-effective-honestly-approved-promotion-strategies/" >use your phone one-handed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, your most frequently used apps are easily accessible.</p><h2 id="Hide-or-Remove-Rarely-Used-Apps"><a href="#Hide-or-Remove-Rarely-Used-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Hide or Remove Rarely Used Apps"></a>Hide or Remove Rarely Used Apps</h2><p> To make your favorite apps easier to find, you can also simply move your rarely-used apps to a less accessible area of your home screens. This way, you’ll have access to them, but these apps won’t get in your way and interrupt your day-to-day phone experience.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-capturing-screens-a-laptops-webcam-journey/" >How to Delete Apps on iPhone and iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p> If you have many apps you rarely use, consider <a class="link"   href="https://howto.techidaily.com/9-solutions-to-fix-honor-x50-gt-system-crash-issue-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/" >uninstalling them <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> entirely. Not only do they get in your way when finding other apps, but they also consume storage space. Plus, the fewer apps you have installed, the smaller your “attack surface” is; you’re reducing the number of pathways <a class="link"   href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/bypassing-glitches-overcoming-game-lockups-in-fallout-3-with-windows-11-systems/" >viruses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/top-10-tecno-camon-20-pro-5g-android-sim-unlock-apk-by-drfone-android/" >hackers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> have to your device.</p><h2 id="Using-Android-Try-a-Different-Launcher"><a href="#Using-Android-Try-a-Different-Launcher" class="headerlink" title="Using Android? Try a Different Launcher"></a>Using Android? Try a Different Launcher</h2><p> A perk of being an Android user is that you have a lot of control over how your phone works, and that includes how apps are found and launched. In fact, there are many <a class="link"   href="https://www.reviewgeek.com/62940/the-7-best-android-launchers/" >alternative app launchers for Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> out there that replace your phone’s default app drawer.

You can either use the Apple Notes app to export your notes as TXT files or the Apple Pages app to export the notes in other <a class="link"   href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-transforming-creativity-into-a-sustainable-livelihood/" >formats like RTF <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, PDF, and more.</p><p> Both methods allow you to export only one note at once.</p><h3 id="Export-an-Apple-Note-as-a-Text-File"><a href="#Export-an-Apple-Note-as-a-Text-File" class="headerlink" title="Export an Apple Note as a Text File"></a>Export an Apple Note as a Text File</h3><p> Exporting a note in the TXT format is super easy. But bear in mind that the TXT format can’t hold text formatting, so you shouldn’t use it if you want to preserve the formatting of your notes.</p><p> To get started, open the Notes app on your iPhone or iPad. Head into the folder containing the note you want to export. Now, open the note and tap the Share button at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/export-apple-notes-on-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="Share button in Apple Notes on an iPhone."                > </p><p> Select “Save to Files” from the Share Sheet that opens up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/export-apple-notes-on-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="Save to Files option in Apple Notes Share Sheet."                > </p><p> By default, Notes will open the save prompt in the “On My iPhone” location in the Files app. If you want to save the note somewhere else, navigate to that location. Then, tap the text field at the bottom of the screen and give an appropriate name to the note file so that it’s easier to find it later.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/export-apple-notes-on-iphone-6.jpg"                      alt="Adding a custom name for the exported note in Files."                > </p><p> Finally, hit the “Save” button to export and save the note in the Files app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/export-apple-notes-on-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="Saving an exported Apple Note in Files app on an iPhone."                > </p><h3 id="Export-an-Apple-Note-as-a-PDF-RTF-or-Word-File"><a href="#Export-an-Apple-Note-as-a-PDF-RTF-or-Word-File" class="headerlink" title="Export an Apple Note as a PDF, RTF, or Word File"></a>Export an Apple Note as a PDF, RTF, or Word File</h3><p> If you want to export an Apple Note in a universally accessible format, use PDF.

If you export a media-rich note in the Markdown format, Exporter will strip away all the media files and put them in a separate folder.

The time it takes to do this depends on the number of notes you have in the Notes app.</p><p> Exporter scans and exports your Apple Notes across all your folders by default.

From free to feature-rich to futuristic, we have some great recommendations to share.</p><h2 id="How-We-Picked-the-Best-Weather-Apps-for-iPhone"><a href="#How-We-Picked-the-Best-Weather-Apps-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="How We Picked the Best Weather Apps for iPhone"></a>How We Picked the Best Weather Apps for iPhone</h2><p> Best anything is always a subjective call, and in the case of the best weather apps for iOS, what makes one app a must-have download and turns you into a lifelong fan may not even be on the radar for another person.</p><p> For some people, that must-have feature might be an elegant or novel interface, a really polished weather radar, pollen or air quality alerts, or any number of things relevant to their health, hobbies, or job.</p><p> Someone else might consider <a class="link"   href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-taking-screenshots-on-chromebook-4-methods/" >the privacy policy of their weather app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-vivo-t2-pro-5g-to-any-ios-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/" >where the weather data comes from <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or whether or not they can add a customized weather widget to their iPhone’s lock screen the most important thing.</p><p> So in our descriptions below, we’ve aimed to highlight some key details about each app to save you from the hassle of downloading and testing them all out—though you might want grab the two that look the most appealing to give them a real-world test drive.</p><h2 id="Best-Free-Weather-App-Apple-Weather"><a href="#Best-Free-Weather-App-Apple-Weather" class="headerlink" title="Best Free Weather App: Apple Weather"></a>Best Free Weather App: Apple Weather</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/iPhoneWeatherApps6.jpg"                      alt="Screenshots showcasing the Apple Weather app."                > </p><p> Historically, you wouldn’t find Apple Weather at the top of any best iOS weather app lists. Like many stock Apple apps, it was there, it was OK, but it wasn’t anything particularly exceptional.</p><p> The time in the doldrums ended for the Weather app when Apple acquired Dark Sky, a wildly popular weather app and service, and used the acquisition to improve Apple Weather and <a class="link"   href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/bard-by-google-emerges-to-test-its-mettle-against-competitor-chatgpt/" >create the WeatherKit API <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Today Apple Weather is significantly more sophisticated than it was years ago. So if you tried it back when you first started using an iPhone and swore off it, it’s worth giving it a second look. The interface has more options, the weather data is more accurate, and many features you’d only find on premium third-party apps, like weather animations and hyper-local reporting, are now integrated into the app.</p><p> As far as recommendations go, we know recommending a stock iOS app as a best weather app candidate isn’t super sexy. But unless you uninstalled it, the app is already on your iPhone, has simple but polished weather widgets for both your home screen and lock screen, and is great for casual use.</p><p> Is it infinitely configurable and customizable? No. Is it free while covering all the basics like alerts, forecasting, air quality, and other expected weather app functions? Absolutely.</p><h2 id="Best-Weather-App-Carrot-Weather"><a href="#Best-Weather-App-Carrot-Weather" class="headerlink" title="Best Weather App: Carrot Weather"></a>Best Weather App: Carrot Weather</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/iPhoneWeatherApps4.jpg"                      alt="Screenshots showcasing the Carrot Weather app."                > </p><p> If you’ve asked your friends what weather app they use or looked into weather apps for your iPhone at all, you’re bound to have come across <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id961390574?platform=iphone" >Carrot Weather <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> On the surface, Carrot Weather is a colorful and fun weather application with a simple art style. While distinctive, the art style is hardly the thing that stands out the most to people. Carrot Weather’s most distinctive trait is the ability to tweak the “personality” of the app to anything from a very professional and impartial weather reporter to a snarky anarchist and anything in between. That might sound ridiculous, and it’s fine if a weather app with a chatty off-cuff personality isn’t for you, but it’s garnered Carrot Weather a cult following.</p><p> Witty remarks about the weather are hardly enough to sell a weather app, though, so thankfully, Carrot Weather is also an extremely customizable app that offers a dizzying array of options for you to rearrange how weather data is displayed in the app and on the home screen and lock screen widgets.</p><p> After Apple’s acquisition of Dark Sky and the shuttering of the Dark Sky app, many Dark Sky users flocked to Carrot Weather to recreate the Dark Sky experience with a familiar interface—Dark Sky fans should check out the “Inline” layout option—and premium features like the weather time machine to look back at the weather.</p><p> Just like we suggested you not write off Apple Weather because it used to be a very lackluster app, we’d also encourage you not to write off Carrot Weather because you’ve heard it’s a snarky weather app. The snark part is optional, and the app and widgets are highly customizable.</p><p> Carrot Weather has a free version as well as three subscription tiers. The Premium tier, which is the best upgrade for most folks, is $4.99&#x2F;month or $19.99&#x2F;year. The upgrade unlocks notifications, customizations, widgets, and Apple Watch complications.</p><p> The Premium Ultra tier costs $9.99&#x2F;month or $39.99&#x2F;year. It includes the Premium tier features plus additional features like rain, lightning, and storm cell notifications, a weather map widget, and quick-switching for weather data sources.</p><p> And if you happen to have a whole family of weather nerds, the best value is Premium Family, $14.99&#x2F;month or $59.99&#x2F;year, which gives you and five family members the Ultra tier (via Apple’s Family Sharing).</p><h2 id="Best-Weather-App-for-Notifications-Weather-Underground"><a href="#Best-Weather-App-for-Notifications-Weather-Underground" class="headerlink" title="Best Weather App for Notifications: Weather Underground"></a>Best Weather App for Notifications: Weather Underground</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/iPhoneWeatherApps5.jpg"                      alt="Screenshots of the Weather Underground app."                > </p><p> Long before other apps were talking about hyper-local weather (or, for that matter, long before there were even mobile apps, period), there was Weather Underground. Founded in 1995, the company has long specialized in very hyper-local weather reporting by aggregating data from the National Weather Service with data from over 250,000 personal weather stations.</p><p> One of the highlights of the <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id486154808?platform=iphone" >Weather Underground app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the detailed weather map with multiple detailed overlays and the ability to easily drill down to specific data on different reporting zones in your area. It’s also notable that Weather Underground doesn’t paywall alerts or advanced weather data.</p><p> It’s also nice that there are two upgrade tiers. If you like the app as it is but would prefer no ads, you can remove ads for only $1.99 a year. They also have a Premium tier ($3.99&#x2F;month or $19.99 a year) that removes the ads, extends the extended forecast from 10 to 15 days, and unlocks Smart Forecasts.</p><p> The Smart Forecasts feature lets you set parameters for the weather and then get automatic notifications based on the conditions. Need a clear windy day to fly a kite or go sailing? A day with an optimal temperature range and low humidity for a hike? Smart Forecasts can alert you that the conditions are perfect for your pursuits.</p><p> However, there is one missing feature that may be a deal breaker for some people. Unlike most of the apps in our roundup, Weather Underground doesn’t have home screen or lock screen widgets (in either the free or paid versions of the app).</p><h2 id="Best-Plain-English-Weather-App-Hello-Weather"><a href="#Best-Plain-English-Weather-App-Hello-Weather" class="headerlink" title="Best Plain-English Weather App: Hello Weather"></a>Best Plain-English Weather App: Hello Weather</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/iPhoneWeatherApps3.jpg"                      alt="Screenshots showcasing the Hello Weather app."                > </p><p> There are a lot of weather apps out there, and so many of them look like you’re accessing a decades-old web page, banner ads, and all, repackaged into an app. <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hello-weather/id978393692?platform=iphone" >Hello Weather <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was created by a small team to get away from that kludgy and cluttered interface feeling and present weather data in a clean and easy-to-understand format.</p><p> It’s one thing to know what the humidity and <a class="link"   href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-enterprise-cloud-solutions-for-2024/" >dew point <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are, for example, but what does that actually mean for you and whether or not you go for a long walk? Is it comfortable? What about changes in barometric pressure? Hello Weather integrates that kind of information in plain English into the forecast data and widgets.</p><p> The app is ad-free and free to use, with a <a class="link"   href="https://helloweather.com/terms" >plain-English privacy policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that makes it clear there is no personal data collected or shared. The free version includes basic customization, a radar, and home screen and lock screen widgets. Upgrading to the premium tier ($1.99&#x2F;month or $14.99&#x2F;year) unlocks Apple Watch complications (which are quite sharp looking), additional data sources, and a slew of customization options.</p><h2 id="Best-Non-traditional-Weather-App-Not-Boring-Weather"><a href="#Best-Non-traditional-Weather-App-Not-Boring-Weather" class="headerlink" title="Best Non-traditional Weather App: (Not Boring) Weather"></a>Best Non-traditional Weather App: (Not Boring) Weather</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/iPhoneWeatherApps2.jpg"                      alt="Screenshots showcasing the Not Boring Weather app."                > </p><p> If you’re really into charts, tables, radar imagery, and the usual trappings of popular weather apps, <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/not-boring-weather/id1531063436" >(Not Boring) Weather <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> probably isn’t for you.</p><p> On the other hand, if you’ve ever wished for a really slick weather app that feels like a slick iOS-only mobile game in the running for game of the year, then the (Not Boring) Weather app might just be for you.</p><p> The app throws traditional weather app design right out the window in favor of turning the interface into a sort of interactive weather fidget toy. The animated weather model and the large temperature readout are 3D modeled and interactive.</p><p> You can rotate and flip them about if you’re so inclined, tap on the model for additional information, or swipe through the interface at the bottom of the screen for forecast data. And if you slide your finger along the weather bar at the bottom, it’ll “play” the forecast for the day like you’re scrubbing through a 3D animation of the weather conditions.</p><p> It’s definitely not for everyone, and if you crave a weather-app-as-command-center experience, you’ll want to look elsewhere. But it’s a really fun and fresh take on the weather app category. The app will run you $14.99 a year, but that includes the weather app as well as the (Not Boring) take on Habits, Calculator, and Timer to expand the 3D-game-looking good vibes to other apps you use on your iPhone, too.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

New iPhones purchased on the Apple Card Monthly Installment Plan must be connected to AT&amp;T, Verizon, or T-Mobile cellular service during checkout. In other words, the Apple Card no longer offers financing for SIM-free iPhones.</p><p> This change was first announced for Apple Store locations in June of 2023, according to <em>MacRumors</em>. The company is simply extending this new policy to online purchases (as it promised it would). If you aren’t with the “big three” carriers, you are effectively barred from enjoying the Apple Card’s generous 24-month 0% APR financing for iPhones.</p><p> Technically speaking, all iPhones are unlocked, even those purchased through Apple Card Monthly Installments. But this new requirement is tantamount to selling locked phones. Some customers may join AT&amp;T, Verizon, or T-Mobile just to get a good financing deal. Or, if a customer is already with one of these carriers, they may stick around to finance future iPhones upgrades.</p><p> You might be able to get around this problem with a cheap prepaid plan—join the plan, get the iPhone, cancel the plan, and take the iPhone to your carrier of choice. But at that point, you’re probably better off with a financing plan from Best Buy or another retailer that’s happy to sell SIM-free iPhones. Or just buy the iPhone with cash. Even with a 0% APR promotional period, debt is a slippery slope.</p><p> Note that this isn’t the only disappointing change to Apple Card’s Monthly Installment policies. Starting today, Apple only offers 12-month financing for the Apple Watch, down from 24 months. Existing installment plans are not affected by these changes, of course.</p><p> If you want to finance a bunch of Apple products at 0% APR, the Apple Card is still one of your best options. However, it’s sad to see Apple chip away at some of the Apple Card’s greatest perks.

Here are some tips to make your iMessage experience more fun and convenient.</p><h2 id="1-Group-Chat-Tagging"><a href="#1-Group-Chat-Tagging" class="headerlink" title="1  Group Chat Tagging"></a>1  Group Chat Tagging</h2><p> Keeping track of large group chats can be tough, and it can be easy for someone to miss a message. If you want to make sure a specific member of your group chat sees a message, you can tag them—they will be notified of the message individually, even if they have notifications for the group chat silenced.</p><p> To do this, first type their contact name. Once your phone recognizes it as a contact name, their contact photo pops up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/contact-name-typed-into-imessage-text.png"                      alt="Contact name typed into iMessage text."                > </p><p> Tap on their contact to tag them. Their name turns blue in the message box, and displays in bold once the message is sent.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/contact-tagged-in-bold-in-an-imessage-group-chat.png"                      alt="Contact tagged in bold in an iMessage group chat."                > </p><h2 id="2-Stickers"><a href="#2-Stickers" class="headerlink" title="2  Stickers"></a>2  Stickers</h2><p> Stickers are a great way to liven up your messages. They are completely customizable, and your iPhone can make a sticker out of almost any image with a clear subject.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-windows-10-key-skills-you-need/" >To create a sticker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, tap the “+” button next to the iMessage box within a conversation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/circled-plus-icon-in-imessage-conversation.png"                      alt="Circled plus icon in iMessage conversation."                > </p><p> From here, you will see a menu with several options. Tap the “Stickers” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/circled-stickers-button-in-imessage-addition-menu.png"                      alt="Circled &#39;Stickers&#39; button in iMessage addition menu."                > </p><p> Here, you will be able to send any stickers you have already made, as well as add new ones. You can select a photo from your photo library by tapping the “+” button. Your iPhone will automatically cut the photo out from its background. If you tap and hold on one of your stickers, you can add fun effects, like a comic or puffy style.</p><p>Close </p><p> Once you’ve created some stickers, you can send them the same way you’d send an image. You can even drag your stickers overtop of messages in your conversation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_4178.jpg"                      alt="Sticker of sunglasses placed on top of a message in iMessage."                > </p><h2 id="3-Edit-and-Unsend-Messages"><a href="#3-Edit-and-Unsend-Messages" class="headerlink" title="3  Edit and Unsend Messages"></a>3  Edit and Unsend Messages</h2><p> Typos are a part of life, but there is a way to fix them! Whether you’ve sent a message to the wrong person or want to fix your spelling mistake, iMessage has you covered. <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-instagram-content-top-15-download-apps-unveiled-for-2024/" >You can unsend an iMessage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> within two minutes of sending, and edit it up to five times within fifteen minutes of sending it.</p><p> To edit or unsend a message, press and hold on the message you want to change. A menu of options will appear, and you can select either “Edit” or “Undo Send”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_4180.jpg"                      alt="iMessage menu options for single message."                > </p><p> If you press “Undo Send”, the message will disappear. The other party will know you’ve unsent a message, but they will not be able to see what it was. If you edit a message, the other person will be able to see that it has been edited, as well as the original.</p><h2 id="4-In-Line-Threads"><a href="#4-In-Line-Threads" class="headerlink" title="4  In-Line Threads"></a>4  In-Line Threads</h2><p> Whether you’re having a long conversation with someone, or have a busy group chat, sometimes you want to respond to a specific iMessage from earlier in the conversation. Luckily, iMessage lets you do so with in-line threads. Replying to a specific message will link your response to it directly, as well as notify the sender that you’ve responded to their message.</p><p> To reply to a specific message, swipe right on the message. This will blur the rest of the conversation and allow you to type your reply.</p><p>Close </p><h2 id="5-Flight-Tracking"><a href="#5-Flight-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="5  Flight Tracking"></a>5  Flight Tracking</h2><p> Communication is key when flying, especially if someone is planning to meet you when you land. Your iPhone can help make your airport communication that much easier with in-app flight tracking, allowing you to see the information about someone’s flight right from the iMessage app.</p><p> To use this feature, simply have your conversation partner send you their flight number. If your phone recognizes it as a valid flight, it will underline it. Tap on the message to see a detailed preview of the flight’s information, including any delays and the assigned baggage carousel.</p><p>Close </p><h2 id="6-Live-Location"><a href="#6-Live-Location" class="headerlink" title="6  Live Location"></a>6  Live Location</h2><p> Trying to coordinate arrivals over text can be tough, but your iPhone has a feature to make this a little easier. You can share your location and request the location of others from within your iMessage conversation.</p><p> To do this, first tap on the “+” icon next to the iMessage box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plus-icon-circled-within-imessage.png"                      alt="Plus icon circled within iMessage."                > </p><p> This brings you to a menu with several options. Tap the “Location” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/imessage-options-menu-with-location-circled.png"                      alt="iMessage options menu with &#39;Location&#39; circled."                > </p><p> From here, you have a few options. You can select “Request” to ask for the other person’s location, which they can accept. You can also share your own location for one hour, until the end of the day, or indefinitely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_16909b176048-1.jpg"                      alt="iMessage location sharing options."                > </p><p> Once a location is shared, the other party can select the message and view the sender’s location in real time.</p><h2 id="7-Recover-Deleted-Conversations"><a href="#7-Recover-Deleted-Conversations" class="headerlink" title="7  Recover Deleted Conversations"></a>7  Recover Deleted Conversations</h2><p> Accidentally delete an important conversation? This iMessage feature can help, as long as the conversation was deleted within the last 40 days.</p><p> To access this feature, tap the “Edit” button in the top-left corner of the iMessages app. Then, tap the “Show Recently Deleted” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_4200.jpg"                      alt="iMessage menu with Show Recently Deleted button circled."                > </p><p> Once you tap this button, you will be able to see conversations you have deleted recently. You can check off any conversations you want to recover, and tap the “Recover” button in the bottom-right corner to return them to your iMessage conversation list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_4198-2.jpg"                      alt="iMessage recently deleted menu with &#39;Recover&#39; button circled."                > </p><h2 id="8-Voice-Recordings-With-Transcriptions"><a href="#8-Voice-Recordings-With-Transcriptions" class="headerlink" title="8  Voice Recordings With Transcriptions"></a>8  Voice Recordings With Transcriptions</h2><p> Don’t feel like typing? iMessage has you covered. You can send a voice message on iMessage for your conversation partner to listen to. It even comes with a transcription, so whoever you send it to can read what you’ve said if they’re unable to listen.</p><p> To get started, tap the “+” icon next to the iMessage box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plus-icon-circled-in-an-imessage-conversation.png"                      alt="Plus icon circled in an iMessage conversation."                > </p><p> Once the “+” button is pressed, you are brought to a menu with several options. Press the “Audio” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/imessage-options-with-audio-button-circled.png"                      alt="iMessage options with &#39;Audio&#39; button circled."                > </p><p> As soon as you press the “Audio” button, your phone starts recording what you say. Once you have completed your message, press the “Stop” icon to end the recording. You can then listen to what you’ve said, and press the Send arrow to send it. Once it has sent, the other person will be able to play your message back, as well as read the transcription created.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_4202.jpg"                      alt="Audio message with transcription sent on iMessage."                > </p><h2 id="9-Message-Effects"><a href="#9-Message-Effects" class="headerlink" title="9  Message Effects"></a>9  Message Effects</h2><p> Have you ever noticed confetti when you text someone “Congratulations”, or balloons when you send “Happy Birthday”? These are iMessage effects, and you can use them whenever you want. There are all kinds of effects you can add to your messages that will play when they are opened. Lasers, hearts, a spotlight—you can even add invisible ink to your message, which will hide the text behind a blur until it’s swiped over.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-does-enter-puk-code-mean-and-why-did-the-sim-get-puk-blocked-on-oppo-device-by-drfone-android/" >To add an effect to your message <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, type out what you want to send, then tap and hold the Send arrow. This allows you to choose your effect, which can either center around the text bubble or fill the entire screen.</p><p>Close </p><h2 id="10-Pinned-Conversations"><a href="#10-Pinned-Conversations" class="headerlink" title="10  Pinned Conversations"></a>10  Pinned Conversations</h2><p> If you text the same people every day, it can get annoying to have to scroll down to them every time you want to send a message. iMessage allows you to pin up to six people to the top of your message app, so you never have to scroll to find them.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-becoming-snapstreak-savvy-tips-for-uninterrupted-connection/" >To pin a contact or group chat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, hold down on the conversation you want to pin, and press the “Pin” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_4208.PNG"                      alt="iMessage conversation with &#39;Pin&#39; option circled."                > </p><p> This anchors that conversation to the top of your Messages app for easy access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/imessage-app-with-pinned-contact-circled.png"                      alt="iMessage app with pinned contact circled."                > </p><p> You can unpin them at any time by pressing and holding on to their contact photo, and then selecting “Unpin”.</p><hr><p> As you can see, Apple’s iMessage is a powerful, versatile app with lots of tricks and features. Once you know everything the app can do, you can start using it to its full potential.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Well, Delta is now optimized for iPad, and it comes with some interesting features to make DS games more manageable.</p><p> The Delta 1.6 update introduces full-screen compatibility and a collection of new controller skins for iPad. While the emulator could already be downloaded on iPad, it couldn’t play at full screen, so it was relatively useless as an iPad app.</p><p> Okay, great, we’ve got Delta emulator on iPad. The only problem is that DS games look really awkward on an iPad in landscape mode. We can spit the DS’ screens into separate app windows on iPad (just as we could on iPhone), but this isn’t always an ideal solution.</p><p> Delta 1.6 introduces some new screen-management functionality to make up for this problem. You can now split each screen of the DS into a separate app window—you can jump between each app window by swiping left or right on the bottom edge of your screen, or you can set the two windows into Split View and adjust their size on the fly.</p><p> Separate app windows can also be accessed through <a class="link"   href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-12-best-tycoon-games-guaranteed-to-hook-you/" >Stage Manager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an oft-forgotten feature that seems perfect for this particular use case. And if you’re tolerant of latency, you can use AirPlay to beam one of the DS screens to a TV, another iPad, or a Mac. Someone on Reddit used the AirPlay trick to turn their iPad and MacBook into <a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Delta%5FEmulator/comments/1e3mqf7/this%5Fis%5Fsuch%5Fa%5Fgreat%5Fway%5Fto%5Fplay%5Fds%5Fgames/" >a giant Nintendo DS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Additionally, Delta allows you to quickly switch between your iPhone and iPad with <a class="link"   href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/guide-to-correcting-windows-10-issue-0xc19001e1-for-a-stable-operating-environment/" >Handoff <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s a pretty compelling feature, although I’m not sure how well it works.</p><p> Other improvements include the ability to “insert” GBA games into a DS (some GBA games <a class="link"   href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/List%5Fof%5FNintendo%5FDS%5Fgames%5Fwith%5FGBA%5Fconnectivity" >benefit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from this), a 3x fast-forward speed, and quick action menu gestures—hold the “menu” button and swipe horizontally to fast-forward, for example.</p><p> And, interestingly, Delta no longer requires BIOS files for games. This does not mean that BIOS files are included with Delta (at least, I hope not), as the third-party distribution of such files violates copyright law. For reference, most GameBoy and DS games only use the BIOS file to show the console bootup screen.</p><p> Eagle-eyed users will also notice that Delta is using a new logo. The old logo, which was just the Greek letter “delta” with a hole in the bottom, led to a <a class="link"   href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/24159268/delta-emulator-logo-change-app" >legal threat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from Adobe. (Ironically, the new logo looks a lot like the top half of a capital “A,” which is what Adobe’s logo is supposed to represent.)</p><p> A full list of Delta v1.6 changes can be found on <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta/releases/tag/v1.6" >GitHub <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> You can install the updated <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688" >Delta emulator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the iOS App Store.

This change brings a new level of convenience to the iPhone, but more importantly, it opens the door to advanced data transfer and charging capabilities. There’s just one problem: Apple isn’t taking full advantage of the USB-C standard. Those who purchase the iPhone 15 or 15 Plus won’t see any groundbreaking technical benefits from USB-C, while tech-savvy iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max buyers are forced to go shopping for an additional accessory—a suitable USB cable.</p><h2 id="The-iPhone-15-and-15-Plus-Are-Stuck-with-USB-2-0-Speeds"><a href="#The-iPhone-15-and-15-Plus-Are-Stuck-with-USB-2-0-Speeds" class="headerlink" title="The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus Are Stuck with USB 2.0 Speeds"></a>The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus Are Stuck with USB 2.0 Speeds</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iphone_usb_c_featured-copy-1.jpg"                      alt="Closeup of a USB-C cable connected to the iPhone 15"                > </p><p>Apple</p><p> Like the <a class="link"   href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-speedy-audio-on-phone-ultimate-list-of-tools/" >USB-C iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that Apple launched in 2022, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus rely on the old USB 2.0 specification. These phones are limited to a maximum 480 Mbps data transfer rate—the same speed that we endured on Lightning-equipped iPhones.Apple is always tight-lipped about charging speed, but its <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-15/specs/" >technical specifications page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> states that the iPhone 15 can achieve “up to 50% charge in around 30 minutes with 20-watt adapter or higher.” The iPhone 14, which charges at a maximum of 20 watts in most third-party tests, has the same statement on its <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-14/specs/" >spec sheet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, meaning that the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus may be limited to 20-watt charging.In other words, the USB-C connector on the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus is little more than a quality-of-life upgrade. The only notable feature provided by this connector is DisplayPort Alt Mode, which allows you to play 4K 60Hz video from the iPhone on a larger computer monitor or TV. Apple suggests that you use its <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUF82AM/A/usb-c-digital-av-multiport-adapter" >USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when connecting the iPhone 15 to a monitor or TV, as this adapter converts USB-C video to HDMI. But if you’re connecting the iPhone 15 to a monitor with USB-C video capabilities, you can simply use a <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Powerline-Delivery-Matebook-Chromebook/dp/B072JYDQ7N/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000332&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/how-fast-is-the-iphone-15s-usb-c-port/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >USB-C cable that supports DP Alt Mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.Limiting the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus to USB 2.0 speeds was an intentional decision, obviously. Apple probably hopes that this limitation will help differentiate the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus from their “Pro” counterparts, which offer proper USB 3.0 speeds. After all, Apple loves to upsell!</p><h2 id="For-USB-3-0-Speeds-Buy-the-iPhone-15-Pro-or-Pro-Max"><a href="#For-USB-3-0-Speeds-Buy-the-iPhone-15-Pro-or-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="For USB 3.0 Speeds, Buy the iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max"></a>For USB 3.0 Speeds, Buy the iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-model-unselect-gallery-1-202309.jpeg"                      alt="Showing hands holding each of the iPhone 15 Pro models"                > </p><p>Apple</p><p> Unlike the standard iPhone 15, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max offer USB 3.0 capabilities (although Apple may be using USB 3.1 Gen 2, judging by the specs). These phones pack a 10 Gbps data transfer rate when paired with an equally powerful USB-C cable, meaning that they’re the best option for customers who regularly shoot <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-efficiently-achieving-color-background-separation/" >RAW photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or 4K videos. Despite the use of a Thunderbolt cable in some press images, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max do not support the <a class="link"   href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-quick-conversion-tips-using-vlc-for-mpeg-4-and-beyond/" >Thunderbolt 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> standard.Charging speed for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max is unknown. However, a peek at the <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-15-pro/specs/" >technical specifications <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> reveals the same notice that’s present on the standard iPhone 15’s spec sheet—“up to 50% charge in around 30 minutes with 20-watt adapter or higher.” The old iPhone 14 Pro can pull 27 watts in third-party tests, so there’s a decent chance that the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max share this limitation (though rumors suggest an upgrade to 35-watt charging).And naturally, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max offer the same DisplayPort Alt Mode capabilities that are present in the basic iPhone 15. You can beam 4K 60 Hz video from the iPhone Pro to a suitable monitor or TV.But, for whatever reason, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max don’t come with a USB 3.0 cable. Instead, they’re bundled with a USB 2.0 cable, which places a 480 Mbps bottleneck on data transfers. If you want to take advantage of the iPhone 15 Pro’s upgraded USB-C port, you need to buy a USB-C cable that supports a 10 Gbps data transfer rate. Apple’s technical specifications make no mention of MFi and simply state that a “USB 3.0 cable with 10 Gbps speed [is] required” for 10 Gbps speeds, so it’s safe to assume that most <a class="link"   href="http://www.amazon.com/Anker-Powerline-Delivery-Matebook-Chromebook/dp/B072JYDQ7N/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000332&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/how-fast-is-the-iphone-15s-usb-c-port/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >USB 3.1 Gen 2 cables <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will get the job done.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/51lw0-1qynl-_sl1200_.jpg"                      alt="Anker USB-C Cable thumbnail"                > </p><h5 id="Anker-USB-C-3-1-Gen-2-Cable-3ft"><a href="#Anker-USB-C-3-1-Gen-2-Cable-3ft" class="headerlink" title="Anker USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 Cable (3ft)"></a>Anker USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 Cable (3ft)</h5><p>Enjoy transfer speeds up to 10Gbps and DisplayPort capabilities with Anker’s USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 cable.

While it’s a nifty feature, it is pretty limited in what you can do with it. We think limiting its use strictly to accessibility features is a missed opportunity.</p><h2 id="How-Does-Apple-Personal-Voice-Work"><a href="#How-Does-Apple-Personal-Voice-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Does Apple Personal Voice Work?"></a>How Does Apple Personal Voice Work?</h2><p> Apple Personal Voice was released with <a class="link"   href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-pioneering-the-use-of-film-in-educational-methodologies/" >iOS 17 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/community-connectivity-accessing-and-using-facebook-groups/" >macOS Sonoma <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and is supported on devices from the iPhone 12 onward, as well as Apple Silicon Macs. To <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/104993"  title="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/104993">set it up <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, head to (System) Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Personal Voice and read a list of phrases aloud and then leave your device plugged in overnight so that it can process and clone your voice using AI.</p><p> You must read 150 phrases aloud to record all of the sounds and inflections of your unique voice, so you’ll probably want to set aside an hour for this (and you’ll be sick of the sound of your own voice by the time you’re done).</p><p> Currently, you can only use your cloned personal voice for <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/105018"  title="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/105018">Accessibility tasks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> within iOS, like using it to speak in phone calls and read text aloud in-person from your phone speaker. With such a cool piece of technology readily available, securely running on your own device, we think there’s an opportunity for Apple to let you do more with it.</p><p> Here’s what we’d love to do with our personal voice (app developers take note).</p><h2 id="Automated-Responses-in-Your-Own-Voice"><a href="#Automated-Responses-in-Your-Own-Voice" class="headerlink" title="Automated Responses in Your Own Voice"></a>Automated Responses in Your Own Voice</h2><p> Imagine if your iPhone could answer a call for you, ask some basic questions in your voice, and then only alert you if the call is important. It’d be a great way to filter out telemarketers, and non-urgent calls (like your partner letting you know they’ve gone to the shops or an appointment confirmation from your doctor) could be summarized and sent to you via iMessage.</p><p> This would be especially useful when you’re otherwise engaged driving, or at the movies, and can’t use your phone.</p><h2 id="Narration-for-Videos-and-Presentations"><a href="#Narration-for-Videos-and-Presentations" class="headerlink" title="Narration for Videos and Presentations"></a>Narration for Videos and Presentations</h2><p> Not everyone is a great narrator. It can be hard to speak consistently and clearly while reading from a script. Conversely, it can be difficult to formulate what you want to say off-the-cuff while speaking unscripted. Being able to write a transcript of what you want to say and then exporting the resulting spoken text it as an audio file could be great for <a class="link"   href="https://howto.techidaily.com/top-4-android-system-repair-software-for-realme-narzo-n53-bricked-devices-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/" >podcasts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-building-brands-and-bonds-on-instagram-steps-to-reach-a-thousand-followers/" >YouTube videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and presentations to help people who aren’t great public speakers.</p><p> Sure, Personal Voice has yet to be perfected by Apple and can sound a bit robotic at times. But in time, as the feature matures, it’s only going to become more convincing.</p><h2 id="Giving-You-the-Perfect-Voice"><a href="#Giving-You-the-Perfect-Voice" class="headerlink" title="Giving You the Perfect Voice"></a>Giving You the Perfect Voice</h2><p> Ever been on a call with someone who has a cold or a sore throat? They don’t sound too good, and this can leave a bad impression. An AI-cloned voice could be used to smooth that out, removing that ‘blocked nose’ nasal sound, sniffing, coughing, and throat clearing while you’re in a meeting. It could also be used to make audio clearer on bad connections or in noisy environments.</p><h2 id="Protect-Your-Voice-and-Identity-From-Being-Used-by-Scammers"><a href="#Protect-Your-Voice-and-Identity-From-Being-Used-by-Scammers" class="headerlink" title="Protect Your Voice and Identity From Being Used by Scammers"></a>Protect Your Voice and Identity From Being Used by Scammers</h2><p> If iOS can replicate your voice, it should be able to detect if someone else is doing the same without your permission. This is especially relevant as <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-optimizing-video-playback-for-engaged-audiences/" >voice cloning scams <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are becoming increasingly common (using recordings of you taken from social media).</p><p> By securely sharing a fingerprint of your voice with your iCloud family and other trusted contacts, they could be warned if they receive a call that is attempting to use a copy of your voice that isn’t actually from you.

    <title>Discontinuation Announcement: Apple Ends Sales of Watch Series 9 &amp; Ultra Models</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Discontinuation-Announcement-Apple-Ends-Sales-of-Watch-Series-9-Ultra-Models"><a href="#Discontinuation-Announcement-Apple-Ends-Sales-of-Watch-Series-9-Ultra-Models" class="headerlink" title="Discontinuation Announcement: Apple Ends Sales of Watch Series 9 &amp; Ultra Models"></a>Discontinuation Announcement: Apple Ends Sales of Watch Series 9 &amp; Ultra Models</h2><p>An ongoing patent dispute will prevent Apple from selling the Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 after December 21st. This is a temporary action, and it is limited to the United States.</p><p> The Apple Watch Series 6 (and all subsequent Apple Watches, minus the SE) use a light-based pulse oximeter sensor to measure the wearer’s blood oxygen saturation. Medical technology Maismo claims that this sensor violates five of its patents. Maismo took Apple to court in 2020 and filed a case with the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) one year later.</p><p> A judge ruled in Maismo’s favor earlier this year. And, in October, the USITC <a class="link"   href="https://investor.masimo.com/news/news-details/2023/United-States-International-Trade-Commission-Issues-Exclusion-Order-for-Infringing-Apple-Watches-Finding-that-Apple-Violated-U.S.-Trade-Laws/default.aspx" >submitted an exclusion order <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for Apple’s latest smartwatches. This order prevents the import of Apple Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 devices after December 25th.</p><p> To show compliance with the USITC, the Apple web store is preemptively pausing Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 sales on December 21st. Brick-and-mortar Apple retail locations will take the same action on December 24th. Retailers like Walmart and Amazon may continue selling the watches, but they will quickly run out of stock.</p><blockquote><p>“A Presidential Review Period is in progress regarding an order from the U.S. International Trade Commission on a technical intellectual property dispute pertaining to Apple Watch devices containing the Blood Oxygen feature. While the review period will not end until December 25, Apple is preemptively taking steps to comply should the ruling stand.”</p></blockquote><p> The USITC’s exclusion order is subject to a 60-day presidential review period. During this period (which ends December 25th), President Biden can veto the exclusion order and allow the continued import of Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 devices. But a veto seems unlikely—the Apple Watch isn’t critical to the U.S. economy, and the USITC’s action won’t have a major impact on Christmas shopping.</p><p> Also, this kind of veto is extremely rare. The Obama administration blocked a USITC exclusion order for the iPhone in 2013, citing the “effect on U.S. consumers” and the principles of fair competition. For previous presidential USITC vetoes, you have to go back to the Reagan and Carter administrations, which shot down a handful of exclusion orders related to industrial manufacturing, cheap alkaline batteries, and computer chips.</p><p> Apple maintains that it has not violated Maismo’s patents. It says that Maismo is using the legal system to “clear a path” for its own smartwatch, which is obviously a competitor to the Apple Watch. Additionally, Apple alleges that Maismo has <a class="link"   href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/apple-lawsuits-say-health-monitoring-company-masimo-copied-apple-watch-2022-10-20/" >infringed on Apple Watch technology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> If the Biden administration does not veto the USITC’s decision, U.S. imports of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 will pause on December 25th. Presumably, Apple will respond by filing an appeal with the Federal Court. Technically speaking, Apple can circumvent the exclusion order by disabling the Apple Watch’s blood oxygen sensor, but this action would be seen as a last resort.</p><p> Source: Apple via <a class="link"   href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-will-pause-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-sales-in-the-us-due-to-a-patent-dispute-142051903.html" >Engadget <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

This is pointless if you always have your iPhone muted. Thankfully, it’s possible to hide it.</p><h2 id="Hide-the-Silent-Mode-Icon-From-Your-iPhone-15-Pro’s-Status-Bar"><a href="#Hide-the-Silent-Mode-Icon-From-Your-iPhone-15-Pro’s-Status-Bar" class="headerlink" title="Hide the Silent Mode Icon From Your iPhone 15 Pro’s Status Bar"></a>Hide the Silent Mode Icon From Your iPhone 15 Pro’s Status Bar</h2><p> It’s pretty easy to remove the Silent mode icon from your iPhone’s status bar.

Then, go into “Sounds &amp; Haptics.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/remove-silent-mode-icon-on-iphone-15-pro-1.jpg"                      alt="Sounds &amp; Haptics settings under iPhone Settings."                > </p><p> Finally, under “Silent Mode,” toggle off the switch next to “Show in Status Bar.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/remove-silent-mode-icon-on-iphone-15-pro-2.jpg"                      alt="Toggling off the Show in Status Bar option in iPhone Settings."                > </p><p> After this, the Silent mode icon will no longer appear in your iPhone’s status bar, even if it’s active.

Simply swipe down from the top-right of the screen to reveal the Control Center and check the status of the bell icon to the right of the Screen Rotation control. Tap it to toggle mute on or off.</p><hr><p> Thanks to the addition of the Silent mode control in the Control Center, you no longer need to use the <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-direct-interaction-enhancing-live-broadcasts-with-desktop-share/" >iPhone 15 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Action Button to toggle Silent mode. As such, you can remap the Action Button to other useful actions, like performing translations or running your favorite shortcuts.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Avoid-Losing-Your-Valuable-Data-on-WhatsApp-Protect-Your-Texts-Multimedia-for-the-Long-Haul"><a href="#Avoid-Losing-Your-Valuable-Data-on-WhatsApp-Protect-Your-Texts-Multimedia-for-the-Long-Haul" class="headerlink" title="Avoid Losing Your Valuable Data on WhatsApp: Protect Your Texts &amp; Multimedia for the Long Haul!"></a>Avoid Losing Your Valuable Data on WhatsApp: Protect Your Texts &amp; Multimedia for the Long Haul!</h2><h3 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>WhatsApp’s backups aren’t foolproof and can lead to data loss.</li><li>WhatsApp’s backup system relies on third-party storage, and local backups aren’t supported on modern Android devices.</li><li>Prevent data loss by archiving chats into a human-readable format and backing up media separately.</li></ul><p> Here’s a horror story for you: WhatsApp nuked all my chats during a botched phone reset. The scary part is it can happen to you, too. I didn’t do anything wrong, which goes to show that WhatsApp’s backups aren’t foolproof. Here’s what you can do to protect your chats.</p><h2 id="Understanding-WhatsApp’s-Makeshift-Backup-System"><a href="#Understanding-WhatsApp’s-Makeshift-Backup-System" class="headerlink" title="Understanding WhatsApp’s Makeshift Backup System"></a>Understanding WhatsApp’s Makeshift Backup System</h2><p> Let me preface this by saying that I’ve never liked WhatsApp. WhatsApp was poorly conceived and designed from the ground up. It’s not seamless at any level. I’m locked into it because my friends and family exclusively use WhatsApp.</p><p> I could go on and on about the issues with WhatsApp, but the worst offender is its jury-rigged backup system. <a class="link"   href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/official-hp-wireless-and-ethernet-driver-downloads-for-various-windows-versions/" >WhatsApp backups <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> work through a third party—either iCloud or Google Drive. You manage the backup yourself on your personal cloud storage. Chats and media upload to that cloud. If you reinstall the app, switch phones, or factory reset the device, WhatsApp lets you restore your backup during the setup. If something goes wrong during that setup and the restore fails, it’ll just start blank. There are no redundancies and no failsafe. And once a backup is gone, it’s gone forever.</p><p> If you’ve ever used <a class="link"   href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-ways-to-stop-parent-tracking-your-realme-12plus-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >Telegram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (a better WhatsApp alternative), you’ll know that it never asks you to set up backups. And you never see a notification every morning that your chats are being backed up. That’s because Telegram quietly handles backup and sync in the background. You can log in anywhere—your phone, desktop, or the browser—and all your chats and media will just be there every time—no progress bars in sight.</p><p> There’s no justification for a modern app to make backups user-facing and to store them in the user’s personal cloud storage on top of that. WhatsApp comes with no instructions on how to secure those backups or how to create redundancies. You can create local backups yourself, but WhatsApp doesn’t let you restore them (more on that in a few). It’ll keep redirecting you to restore from the cloud.</p><p> There are dozens of posts on <a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/" >&#x2F;r&#x2F;WhatsApp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> complaining about lost chats and backup fails. It’s a pretty common issue, but Meta has made zero efforts to address it.</p><h2 id="The-Incident"><a href="#The-Incident" class="headerlink" title="The Incident"></a>The Incident</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/52862665915_ed59c61a75_o.jpg"                      alt="WhatsApp on an iPhone."                > </p><p>Jason Montoya &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Which brings us to the incident. My WhatsApp is set to create daily backups of my media and chat history. Those daily backups turned into almost five years of chats and media stored on my Google Drive. I’ve successfully restored that backup a couple of times when switching phones. It was never seamless, but it got the job done.</p><p> Everything went wrong when I recently had to factory reset my phone. I made a routine backup of my chats and media to Google Drive (I also downloaded the backup database file to my PC for safekeeping). Then, I proceeded with the reset. After the reset, I installed WhatsApp, logged in, and tapped “Restore” on my Google Drive backup. The size of this backup was much smaller than usual.</p><p> The app said it was loading the chat media in the background and showed me a progress bar on top. But my private text chains were missing, and the rest were blank (only the groups were showing up). I panicked and tried to restore my backup by reinstalling WhatsApp. No luck.</p><p> Turns out, WhatsApp overwrote the original backup with a blank at some point during the reset. I lost years of cherished texts and media (I hadn’t backed them up anywhere other than the WhatsApp backup). It was disappointing, to say the least.</p><p> I didn’t lose all hope because I had a copy of the backup saved on my disk. But WhatsApp refuses to play nice with its own backup files. It kept redirecting me to the cloud backup every time I tried to load the downloaded backup file. For some unknown reason, you need to be <a class="link"   href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/6181521285295518/?cms_platform=android" >on Android 9 or below <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to be able to restore local backups. WhatsApp axed local backup support for modern Android devices.</p><p> So that’s where we currently stand. WhatsApp nuked the backup I had on Google Drive and replaced it with a blank file. The local copy I created to deal with exactly this situation won’t work because WhatsApp doesn’t support its own local backups anymore.</p><h2 id="How-to-Prevent-WhatsApp-Data-Loss"><a href="#How-to-Prevent-WhatsApp-Data-Loss" class="headerlink" title="How to Prevent WhatsApp Data Loss"></a>How to Prevent WhatsApp Data Loss</h2><p> You can back up your media separately in the cloud or on a physical drive. For entire chats, you can archive them individually into a human-readable format and back up that archive.</p><p> Open a chat you want to back up, tap the three dots on top, then “More,” and select “Export Chat.” WhatsApp will ask you if you want to export the chat “Without Media” or “Include Media.” Pick one and wait for WhatsApp to process the zip file. When it’s done, a share menu will pop up on the bottom that lets you copy the zip file to your phone storage or share it with other apps.</p><p>Close </p><p> You can choose to include media in that zip file, but it will not include every media file in the chat, just the most recent ones. How many files exactly and how recent is anyone’s guess, because the WhatsApp Help Center doesn’t specify anything. I recommend manually backing up every important media file. It will not include the entire text history either. You can get up to 100,000 of your most recent texts in that chat.</p><p> I couldn’t manage to restore the local backup. But it is technically possible to restore from a local database. So here’s how you can create a local, encrypted backup.</p><p> Open your preferred <a class="link"   href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/new-beyond-imagination-the-best-sci-fi-metaverse-films-for-adventurers/" >File Explorer app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and open WhatsApp &gt; Databases. You’ll see a few CRYPT14 files. The most recent file is your latest backup, which you can copy to another location or device.</p><p>Close </p><hr><p> Never trust WhatsApp backups. If you’ve been waiting to copy some important files or texts from your WhatsApp chats, now’s the time. Learn from my misfortune. I hope it never happens to you.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>
